The agreement gives Starbreeze SEK 127,6 million and extends the partnership an additional 24 months.\nNINE-MONTH PERIOD (JULY 2014 \u2013 MARCH 2015)\n- Net sales amounted to SEK 125,5 million (SEK 162,5 million).\n- Operating income before depreciation, EBITDA, amounted to SEK 47,3 million (SEK 131,4 million).\n- Profit before tax amounted to SEK 35,4 million (SEK 119,9 million) and profit after tax amounted to SEK 24,6 million (SEK 101,8 million).\n- Earnings per share before dilution were SEK 0,17 (SEK 0,73) and earnings per share after dilution were SEK 0,17 (SEK 0,72).\nAFTER THE PERIOD\n- In April, Starbreeze signed a SEK 86,2 million console distribution agreement with 505 Games for OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead.\n- In April, Starbreeze share of the revenue for PAYDAY 2 sales via the PC platform Steam amounted to SEK 3,1 million.\nCEO BO ANDERSSON KLINT GIVES HIS COMMENT \u2013 SUMMARY\nStarbreeze acceleratesNet sales amounted to SEK 47,7 million, an increase by 49-percent year on year. Total income for the quarter is Starbreeze best since the launch of PAYDAY 2 in August 2013.\nOur pulse strategy continues to work exceptionally well and PAYDAY 2 as a product has driven sales in a great way. In addition we\u2019re excited to see the product PAYDAY 2: Crimewave Edition for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release in June together with our distribution partner 505 Games.\nWe\u2019ve previously communicated our plan to increase our production capacity, while our broadened portfolio and establishment in the US is increasing our investment rate as planned. We\u2019re building Starbreeze to be a pioneer where we by an expanded portfolio, accelerated R&D and new collaborations significantly strengthen our offers. Our PAYDAY business is continuing to be profitable and enables investments in future products and technologies. The increased cost is in line with our strategy to further invest in the company\u2019s future and not a result of administrative overhead.. We\u2019ve grown the organization and added several senior developers to our roster, as well as head hunted an experienced CFO, all of them already influencing the organization in many positive ways. Our budgeting, investment tempo and cost control processes have all been improved.\nAs CEO of Starbreeze it\u2019s very inspiring to see the team and board of directors alike work so closely and energetically towards the same tactical and strategic goals. We\u2019ve managed to execute on our strategy faster than expected and I\u2019m excited to realise our future opportunities as well as future product launches.\nDuring the quarter we released 26 updates to PAYDAY 2 and announced a new collaboration with 505 Games worth a total of SEK 127,6 million for the continued development of PAYDAY 2. We\u2019ve also signed a SEK 86,2 million console distribution agreement with 505 Games for OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead.\nOur current cash position together with future cash flows resulting from the above agreements, amounting to SEK 379 million, are funds available to develop our products and strategy during the next two years. Income from PAYDAY: The Heist and PAYDAY 2 will continue to generate an underlying cash flow which creates a good foundation for future events. With our ambition to grow our business and in the role as both publisher and a developer, our plan to implement a dual share structure with A&B shares is crucial. The change will enable us to acquire and form strategic collaborations without the risk of losing control over the company. We can maintain our independence and entrepreneurship and at the same time increase liquidity in our share, on both current and future markets.\nIn the near future, we\u2019re looking to acquire smaller companies to dynamically expand our technology stack and competencies. Starbreeze will grow best through partnerships and acquisitions. We\u2019ll continue to gain market share through all of 2015.\nThese words are written in Los Angeles, where I\u2019m now sitting in our new offices which we\u2019ll soon be able to share with the world. In April we also took the decision to expand our capacity in Stockholm, where we\u2019re looking forward to moving to the venerable NK building.. We also look forward to further cement our role as a publisher and exploring more collaborations and projects like our recently announced deal with the Croatian developer Lion Game Lion for the upcoming game RAID: World War II.\nLet\u2019s have a nice summer and let\u2019s do this!\n###For more information please contact:.\n\nUser question:\nWhat was the net sales amount for Starbreeze AB in the third quarter from January to March 2015?\n"}

I won't use this on my face, but it's the only cleanser i use for sensitive private areas. It's good to have on hand, in case your skin gets chapped and you can't tolerate soap.

The gentle ingredients take care of the skin and I love how my face never feels tight after washing. The scent is soft and subdued, perfect for those with sensitive skin.

I just love the way it gently cleanses and soothes, removing daily oil and dirt buildup without stripping the skins' natural oils.

I only use it in the morning when I just have to wash off last night's cream. The reason I keep buying it is because I can't find another gentle cleanser that doesn't strip my skin.

{"prompt": "Context:\nI Piss a a new family. He accepted his aunt\u2019s hospitality and wen to live there with his first born son, Jean Monet,2 who was born in 1867. Camille remained in Paris (they married three years later in 1870). His family still refused to offer him any assistance. This marked the beginning of a lifestyle which was becoming increasingly transient, culminating in Monet\u2019s move to London in the early 1870\u2019s to avoid involvement in the Franco-Prussian War. Here Monet was exposed to the English masters Constable and Turner. Later, Monet returned to Le Havre where he continued his extensive practice of landscape paintings.\nIn 1872 he settled at Argenteuil3 where he, Jean and Camille lived for six years. Frequently joined by Renoir and other friends from his student days, Monet painted every aspect of life and the world out doors. Renoir and Manet also moved to Argenteuil. Monet could often be found painting on his Floating Studio4. Here the three men shared their ambition and love of landscape painting.\nIn 1874, Manet, Degas, C\u00e9zanne, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Monet put together the popular exhibition of the \u2018Cooperative Society of Artists, Painters, Sculptors and Engravers\u2019 which was unfortunately a disaster. Critics were extremely vicious. They set out to destroy the lives and self-esteem of the painters. The exhibition characterized a return to financial insecurity for Monet and it was only the intercession of Manet that has allowed Monet and his family to continue their quaint life at Argenteuil.\nIt was here that the label of \u201cImpressionist\u201d was first used. While attempting to offend one of Monet\u2019s painting, Impression: Sunrise5, the critic Charivari termed him an impressionist and later applied the label to the entire group. After some consideration the artists themselves began to embrace this term and use it to describe their movement and their objectives.\nIn 1975 their work was shown at a auction in the Hotel Drouot. More ridicule was evoked here than at the Salon. Although success seemed miles away, the painters had already acquired a number of affluent patrons. Despite almost constant rejection and financial insecurity, Monet\u2019s paintings never became sullen nor dreary. Instead, Monet immersed himself in the task of perfecting a style which still had not been accepted by the world at large. He began to work on a number of series, starting in 1876 on the Saint-Lazare Railway Station6. Here he imbued the theme of man and nature being one. He attempted to romanticize the railway through the medium of light.\nthrough the following years the impressionist painting began to popularize. The second and third Impressionist exhibits brought more success than the first. Success was now in view and once again, with the help of his friend Manet\u2019s help, he was able to rent a house in the cozy village of Vetheuil. During that year, in 1878, Camille bore him a second son, Michel Monet. She passed away the following year, in September of 1879, never seeing her husband rise to the height of his potential.\nThe fourth Impressionist exhibition was held later that year; it was the biggest success for the group yet. From here on. it was all uphill. After do many years of destitution and strife, this partial success led the group to break up, tempting each member to seek the liberty of individual expression. The following exhibition (1880) lacked the title \u201cImpressionist\u201d and the participation of Monet, Sisley, Renoir and Cezanne. The sixth exhibition in 1871 had the same result. Then, in 1882 an attempt of reconciliation was made on behalf of the artists. They participated, yet it was apparent that the audacious stage was over and that impressionism was soundly established in society, the hostility had ended and the paintings were well received. During that year he made his last group exhibition.\nMonet spent most his days painting. In 1881 he moved to Poissy with the family of an acquaintance the Hoschedes. The traveled vastly during that time. In 1883 he made his first step toward actual stability when he settled at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life.\nHe had many large one-man shows arranged for him around the world in places such as Berlin, Boston and London. The popularity of impressionism was progressively expanding. For every insult he had ever incurred he now received praise.\nIn 1892 Monet married Alice Hoschede, with whom he had had an affair during his marriage to Camille. In that year he painted with the realization that every aspect of the scene was altered in accordance with the changing light. This was to become an obsession in his later years. At last, Monet gained notoriety. He knew several important people and he became financially secure for the first time in his life. He once again began work on several series including the Haystacks7 (1890-1893, Poplars (1890-1891 and the Rouen Cathedrals8 (1892- 1895). With this new found luxury Monet was able to devote himself to gardening which, in turn, provided a motif for the painter\u2019s last important work, the Water Lilies9 series. Monet was absorbed in this project almost exclusively from 1900 until his death.\nHe continued his traveling throughout Europe. His son Jean married one of Mme. Hoschede\u2019s daughter in 1897. Monet\u2019s eight sight began to deteriorate in 1900 after an accident and would continue throughout the rest of his life due cataracts. His wife parted in the spring of 1911 and his son Jean in the winter of 1914.\nOf the great impressionists, Monet lived the longest. He died on September 26, 1926 at Giverny. He watched his friends and acquaintances leave his world, and watched the world take on a significant amount of change. He spent his last years secluded from the world working on a state commission for a water-lillies mural which was to be installed in the basement of the Tuileries Garden. The impressionist had contributed a great deal to society and left a lasting impression on the world of art. He had reached the heights of his dreams and lead a fulfilling life.\nImpressionism sought to revitalize artistic vision through the use of colored shadows, the exclusion of black and the use of bright colors. The paintings of Monet also revolve around the fluid qualities of water and light and the importance of speed. It paved the road for many other forms of art, such as Divisionism and Pointillism. It also inspired many other artists, among these are Van Gogh anf Gauguin.\nMonet\u2019s vision is alive and well and today. The works of Monet and the other impressionists can be found in Museums worldwide. The once-controversial form of art has become a classic which will continue to be honored as long as water-lillies grace our gardens.\n\nUser question:\nWhat was the term used to describe Monet and his group of artists, and who first used it?\n"}

{"prompt": "Context:\nThe Corporate Credit Team at Janus Henderson Investors explain the benefits of integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into investment decision-making. Key takeaways The concept of ESG analysis has evolved over the years and is becoming integral to fundamental credit research. The Corporate Credit Team believes that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns. Sound investment sense, growing client demand and efficient capital allocation underscore the importance and relevance of ESG analysis. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability of an investment. It was derived from the \u2018Triple Bottom Line\u2019, also known as the \u2018People, Planet and Profits\u2019 (PPP), a concept introduced in the 1990s. It argued that businesses should focus on each of the three \u2018P\u2019s and not just on \u2018Profits\u2019, since they were equally important for any commercial enterprise to be sustainable. This concept evolved into the focus of ESG, which today is the bedrock of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI). /> Environmental criteria examine how a business contributes to and performs on environmental challenges (e.g. waste, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and climate change). Social criteria look at how the company treats people (e.g. human capital management, diversity and equal opportunities, work conditions, health & safety, and product misselling), while Governance criteria examine how a company is governed (e.g. executive remuneration, tax practices and strategy, corruption and bribery, and board diversity and structure). At the heart of ESG investing is the simple idea that companies are more likely to succeed and deliver strong returns1 if they create value for all their stakeholders \u2013 employees, customers, suppliers and wider society including the environment \u2013 and not just the company owners. Consequently, ESG analysis considers how companies serve society and how this impacts their current and future performance. ESG analysis is not just about what the company is doing today. Consideration of future trends is critically important and should inherently include disruptive change that can have significant implications for a company\u2019s future profitability or its very existence. Our approach to ESG analysis We look at companies in-depth from E, S and G perspectives to evaluate their standing relative to peers. Our ESG philosophy is built on the belief that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns and company engagement is an integral part of successful investing. Just as with other credit metrics, we would expect improving ESG profiles to lead to a lower cost of capital. We believe companies that pursue meaningful ESG improvement should increase the potential to outperform as the cost of capital declines and credit spreads tighten. Conversely, if a company has material ESG risks and is not actively mitigating these risks and improving their ESG profile, it is very likely that its bond prices will suffer. Identifying and measuring ESG risks and opportunities has the benefit of simultaneously supporting environmental and social benefits. There are many ways to incorporate ESG into investment decisions. The main applications tend to be ethical/values-based investing, integrated ESG and sustainable/impact investing. In ethical investing managers employ a negative screen approach to generate \u2018ethical or moral returns\u2019 and screen out controversial \u2018sin\u2019 sectors. While negative screening is very straightforward to implement and has historically been used by early adopters of sustainability principles, a growing number of firms are now also aiming to apply ESG in order to take advantage of opportunities and select sectors and companies based on their positive ESG performance. This leads to a more holistic ESG integration that is better placed to maximise risk-adjusted returns. Impact managers go a step further in applying ESG considerations and aim to deliver positive impact via their investments in companies and governments that generate a measurable net positive impact for society and the environment alongside positive returns. There is no one way to apply ESG, so understanding how an investment manager applies ESG in their investment process in order to achieve the strategy\u2019s objective is important for clients. Why do we care? Because it makes sound investment sense It is our fundamental belief that ESG considerations enhance risk-adjusted return potential by reducing investment risk and creating investment value. A well run and responsible company that cares about its people, customers and the environment, we believe, is more likely to exhibit a greater level of resilience and outperform its peers than one that does not. ESG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors that can have a significant impact on the financial metrics of a company and therefore better inform our investment decisions. ESG analysis can be complex. When taking ESG considerations into account, it is not just a case of evaluating the products and services provided by a company, but also its behaviour, conduct, supply chain and other considerations in running the business. ESG analysis must also consider the future, taking into account not only a company\u2019s latest ESG disclosures, but also its strategy, overall impact and evidence that it is keeping to its commitments and standards. Hence we believe it is not advisable to formulate investment decisions based on purely backward looking historical data and believe a more forward-looking, dynamic approach is needed when considering ESG risks and opportunities. This is why our proprietary ESG analysis and ESG ratings are integrated into our credit research. While exclusion-based strategies adopt a negative approach to investing, our holistic approach to ESG takes a more positive stance and also looks for opportunities where companies are actively transitioning and improving their ESG profiles. The combination of improving credit stories and improvement on ESG grounds can help achieve positive outcomes for the environment and society. Because our clients care In our most recent survey of client attitudes, when asked about the importance of ESG integration in investment, 78% of clients said it was as or more important than five years ago.2 Furthermore, by 2025, the so-called \u2018values-driven generation\u2019 \u2013 millennials \u2013 will represent three-quarters of the global workforce.3 A Morgan Stanley study found that millennials are twice as likely as the general population to invest in companies with social or environmental goals.4 And in North America alone this generation, alongside Generation X, is set to share a wealth transfer in the region of $30 trillion from their baby boomer predecessors in coming years.5 The pressure from asset owners to invest responsibly and have a more sustainable mindset is therefore expected to grow significantly. Because we believe that facing up to sustainability challenges and strategically allocating capital can help make good long-term investment decisions The world faces major sustainability challenges \u2013 such as climate change, ageing population, and inequality \u2013 which require radical solutions that will bring huge yet hard to predict changes to the global financial system. By facing up to these challenges, recognising that capital allocation decisions have a real impact on the world, and holding bold visions of the future, investors can hope to make good long-term investment decisions. 1Various studies exist that demonstrate that incorporating ESG factors can have a beneficial influence on returns. For example, \u201cSustainable Investing and Bond Returns: Research study into the impact of ESG on credit portfolio performance\u201d, Barclays 2016. 2Janus Henderson Customer Panel, October 2019. 3Big demands and high expectations, The Deloitte Millennial Survey, 2014. 4Sustainable Signals.

The floors are great, but we needed some softening to make this a comfortable area to sit and watch movies. The rug pad is underneath an indoor/outdoor area rug and really makes a difference in two ways: 1) the rug feels more lux with the padding underneath it--much springier, and 2) the rug doesn't move around on the shiny, slippery floor.

However, I had read reviews for a similar rug (different design) where people said the rug was thinner than they thought it would be when the rug actually arrived. I asked Overstock customer reps if there could've been a typo on the 0.625 inch description and they said no. I asked them if the 0.625 inch was just for the black floral design or all over the rug. (I thought from the photo that maybe it was raised in some areas and not in other parts. Although it was really hard to tell in the photo.) They said it was 0.625 inches high all over the rug. I asked what \"woven\" meant in the description, because woven tends to mean a thinner rug. They said that's \"how it was made\". I asked if I could return the rug if the rug did not match the description, without my having to pay shipping. They said yes, they would pay the shipping. I ordered it and lo and behold, it was definitely NOT 0.625 inches. It was about 0.25 inches, at most. Even if it was just a thin rug, I may have been able to deal with it, but the brown/ tan part of the rug was like a ROUGH BURLAP-like material. I was planning on having this rug indoors and I don't want to walk on burlap. If you look at the photo, you can see that the tan part makes up the majority of the rug. I returned it promptly. Overstock kindly waived the shipping fee back to them, however, they did not refund the shipping fee I paid originally to have it shipped to me.!\nThu Oct 23 00:00:00 MDT 2014thriftymama Rating:2.0\nYes the rug came a lot quiver then i expected, and yes the design is much like the picture. HOWEVER! the quality is awful! it is extremely light, meaning it moves around very easily. The material is cheap and not nice to walk barefoot on. If anything this rug is an outdoor mat. If i had a 12 ft long hallway in my backyard, this is where it would go. Not pleased at a lll, not worth the money. Don't buy cheap rugs, learned my lesson.

I had it laying flat in an open area in my bedroom with items weighting down the edges so it would uncurl. The pattern is super nice. It is contemporary and rustic all rolled into one. I put it under my king sized bed over hardwood floors in my log home. It definitely needs a rug pad for under it to preserve your floors.

Those same\ncalls appear in original 1808 entry and survey, the 1810 grant and the\n1854 purchase of the tract by William West. We know that the tract is in\nthe Second Surveyors District on the Barren Fork River. However, the\ncalls do not tell us where on the river the tract was located.\nFortunately, the documents do state that the tract was joined by entry No.\n782 in the name of the heirs of Moses Davis. Entry No. 782 and subsequent\ndocuments place this second, or as we call it, key tract on\nthe eastern edge of the Second Surveyors District.\nGrant No. 2309 to George Michie, 1810.\n... There is granted by the said state of\nTennessee, unto to George Mitchie assignee of the said George Howard a cetrain tract or\nparcel of land containing two hundred acres the residue of said Warrant lying in Warren\nCounty in the second District on both sides of Barren Fork of Collins river Beginning on\na hickory ten poles North of the North West corner of entry numbered seven hundred and eight\ntwo in the name of the heirs of Moses Davis running thence West fifty chains to a black oak\nand hickory near the County road thence south forty chains to a black oak crossing the river\nat thirty one chains on the ridge on the South side of the river thence East fifty chains to a\nblack oak in the line of said Davis thence with it and passing the corner to the beginning\nSurveyed September 19th 1808 by Patrick McEachern DS ...\nLarger image of Grant, 240k, (Scan\ncourtesy Gilbert West). Image made from a scan of a photocopy from a TSLA microfilm of the original recording.\nGrant No. 2929 to the heirs of Moses Davis, 1811.\n... There is granted by the said\nSTATE OF TENNESSEE, unto to the\nsaid Moses Davis and their heirs a cetrain Tract of LAND, containing two hundred acres\npart of a Warrant -------- lying in Warren County in the Second District, seventh\nfractional section in fractional range on both sides of Barren Fork of Collins river\nBeginning at a post oak ninety five poles south of the one mile tree of said Section,\nin the Eastern boundary line of said District running thence West fifty chains to a post\noak among pointers thence South forty chains to an elm near the bank of the river thence\neast fifty chains to a black Oak in the Second District line thence with it to the\nBeginning Surveyed September 19th 1808, by Patrick MacEachern DS ...\nLarger image of Grant, 158k, (Scan\ncourtesy Gilbert West). Image\nmade from a scan of a photocopy from a TSLA microfilm of the original recording. On the larger image, you will note that the printed Nashville is\nstruck out and Knoxville is handwritten. That is because the recorded grant is a copy in\na pre-printed book. Knoxville was the first capital of the State of Tennessee 1796-1812 and at\nthe time of this 1811 grant. From 1812 to 1815 Nashville was again the seat of government,\nand from 1819 to 1825, Murfreesboro served as the state capital. In 1826 the captial was again\ntransferred to Nashville, where it still remains today.\nA third Brown tract just to the east of 2nd/3rd\nDistricts line demonstrates how the Brown family controlled many acres along the\nBarren Fork River and on Old Shelbyville Road east of Crisp.\nAbout the Wm Brown survey and Thomas Vaughan grant: we could\nnot find the Wm Brown entry, this is the first step of getting a grant. Unlike the\nMichie and the Davis heirs grants, Wm Brown had a survey based on his prefference\nright or occupant claim. The other two were based on North Carolina\nMilitary Warrants. We also could not find a grant to Wm Brown. Occupant\nclaims required payment to the State of Tennessee and since the tract\nin the 1808 survey was not granted to Wm Brown, we can assume that he did not\npay the State of Tennessee.\nIt appears that in 1811 Thomas Vaughan entered on the same\ntract and also submitted Wm Browns 1808 survey to the Tennessee Land Office.\nIt was granted to Thomas Vaughan in 1814. There is the possibility that Wm Brown\nhad an arrangement with Thomas Vaughan to later purchase all or part of the tract, or perhaps he\nrented from Thomas Vaughan.\nIn any case, Thomas Vaughan used a Certificate issued by the Register of\nWestern Tennessee to qualify for the grant.\nA second tract of three acres granted to Thomas Vaughan actually\njoins the west side of the Brown three hundred acre survey and this tract of three\nacres is ... near to the eastern boundary of the 2nd District ... Hence,\nwe are able to plat the location of the two 3rd District tracts and place them in\nrelationship to the two 2nd District tract.\n... by virtue of part of Certificate Number 53 dated Feb. 7, 1810, issued by\nthe Registrar of Western Tennessee to William P. Anderson and entered on 7th day\nof Aug 1811 ... under an act of 1807. Granted by the State of Tennessee unto\nThomas Vaughan, assignee of William P. Anderson for 300 acres in Warren County\nin the Third District on both sides of the Barren Fork of Collins River in boundary\nline Walter M. Daniel and William Brown. [Signed] Willie Blount, Governor of Tenn.,\nAug. 11, 1814, W. G. Blount, Secretary.\nAbstract from Moses Park, 1738-1828 -- Vaughan and Wilcher, by Clara Lorene\n(Cammack) Park and Wilbur Goolsby Park, Sr. Gateway Press, Inc., 1991.\n\nUser question:\nWho was the title of the Red Bank or Browntown farm vested in after being divested out of the heirs and creditors of Wm West?\n"}

{"prompt": "Context:\n.\nFounded in 1647... blogging 360 years later. The first public school district in America, Boston Public Schools proudly serves more than 56,000 pre-k through 12th graders in 125 schools.\nTuesday, July 27, 2010\nINDIA New England names Edwards Middle School assistant principal 2010 Woman of the Year\nMonday, July 26, 2010\nTobin K-8 principal appears on 'CityLine'\nOver the weekend, Tobin K-8 principal Cheryl Watson-Harris was a guest on WCVB-TV's \"CityLine\" program. Host Karen-Holmes Ward invited her to participate in a discussion about the importance of community partnerships in a child's education.\nWatson-Harris is a great example of a school leader who has brought non-profits, community groups and individuals into her school to help all students succeed. For years, she has spread the message that children from low-income families tend to lose an average of three months' literacy and two months' math skills during summer break. Put another way, it takes some children three months or more of schoolwork in the fall just to get back to where they were when they left their classrooms in June. Like many of our school leaders and teachers, Watson-Harris has worked tirelessly to help students enroll in productive summer programs.\nThe topic of the CityLine program was the \"Opportunity Agenda,\" a groundbreaking partnership between some of Boston's leading philanthropic and nonprofit organizations. Together, these partners have pledged more than $27 million to help Boston's children succeed. The donations will be used to help nonprofits expand and coordinate their work inside and outside our classrooms -- to make sure that all of our students have the support they need to excel. The Opportunity Agenda has aligned many of its goals with the BPS Acceleration Agenda, which calls for increasing student standards and performance across all levels within the next four years.\nPosted by Lee McGuire at 10:19 AM No comments:\nLinks to this post\nFriday, July 23, 2010\nBoston teachers volunteer in the Dominican Republic this summer\nThis..\nPosted by Melissa Duggan at 2:48 PM No comments:\nLinks to this post\nThursday, July 22, 2010\nBPS in the News: Dorchester Reporter story on Haitian children who came to BPS after the earthquake\narticle about students who came to the Boston Public Schools after the earthquake in Haiti earlier this year.

Menino and Superintendent Carol R. Johnson joined hundreds of students for a special barbecue lunch on July 13 at the Mildred Avenue K-8 School to kick off a summer of healthy eating and launch the Summer Food Service Program. This event was the first in a series of healthy barbecues that BPS and BCYF will host this summer at locations throughout the city to highlight the importance of healthy eating and the benefits of fresh, local foods.\nChef Kirk Conrad and his student \u201csous-chefs\u201d from the Boston Collaborative for Food and Fitness Youth Advisory Board prepared healthy side dishes to be served at the barbecue using local produce from Czajkowski Farms in Hadley, MA. On the menu were corn-on-the cob, cold green bean salad, and fresh blueberries.\nDr. Johnson also stopped by the Boston Public Health Commission's booth and signed the \"Soda-Free Summer Pledge,\" a promise not to drink soda for the entire summer.\nThe summer meals program provides free daily meals for children ages 18 and under at approximately 148 sites and programs across the city and runs through September 3.

The station closed to passenger traffic in the mid 1950's.\nRoad Transport: The village is currently served by 'Arriva Midlands' bus service Nos. 56/56A, which operates to Leicester via Thurnby Turn and A47 Uppingham Road, the basic frequency is every 30 minutes daytimes Mondays to Saturdays (No service Evenings, Sundays or Bank Holiday Mondays) and is also currently served by West End Travel 'Rural Rider' service No. RR5 (Weds.) and RR11 (Sats.) between Oakham - Tilton - Hungarton - Leicester on Wednesdays and Saturdays only (1 trip in each direction). For Up-to-date timetables of current local and national bus services see the website : Past road transport in Scraptoft: For many years from the 1930's the village was served by the \"Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd.\" (B.M.M.O.) more commonly known as 'Midland Red', with Services operated by that company to Leicester L29 (later 93 from 1973, later 79/89 from 1980 as 'Midland Red' and later 'Midland Red East' Services and then M2 later 52 from 1985 as 'Midland Fox' and 'Fox cub' services - see below), also the 599 service between Leicester and Hungarton which passed through the village irregularly (Later 598 from 1968, later 649 Extended to Thorpe Satchville via Barsby in 1977 and later 'Midland Red East' twice weekly 149 Leicester - Scraptoft - Beeby - Hungarton - Ingarsby - Keyham - Scraptoft - Leicester (Circular) in 1980 and discontinued from c1983) and a variation of this route for a few years in the early 1960's was a service No. X64 which continued beyond Hungarton to Twyford and John 'O Gaunt Station which largely ran as a commuter service and replaced the discontinued train service which had ran previously, known as the workers' service, but this had ceased by 1965. Also for a spell in the later 1970's a once weekly shopper service to Market Harborough via Billesdon and Hallaton on Tuesdays only No. 653 (later 148 in 1980 until c1984 when discontinued by 'Midland Red East' and taken over by Fosse Travel - see below). The Midland Red Omnibus Co. Ltd (since 1973 and formed out of the BMMO) became known initially as 'Midland Red East' in 1981 whilst still in National bus company/public ownership, and then as 'Midland Fox' in the mid 1980's when privatised, post de-regulation, then mid 1990's as 'Arriva fox county' and since the late 1990's the currently named 'Arriva Midlands'.\n'Leicester Citybus' ran a Service 72 through the Village through a few years during the 1990's, Which started in Leicester City Centre and ran via London Road, Evington, General Hospital and Thurnby Lodge to Scraptoft Village.\nOther Operators known to have run services through, to or from Scraptoft were Hincks, Hungarton until c1930 (When taken over by BMMO), Nesbit Bros.Coaches of Somerby with a Tuesdays only service to Melton Mowbray (1976 until approx mid 1980's) and in the mid-1980's for a few years a replacement for the former Midland Red service 148 listed above operated by Fosse Travel.

The village has a small Co-operative food store, and adjacent Post office. During the mid 1970's It once boasted a short-lived Cafe on Main Street, called 'The Bambi cafe', which was followed for some years by a fruiterers/grocers and florist (now a private dwelling).\nThe famous 'Quorn Hunt' used to meet regularly through the hunting season on Fridays in the Village, at the Nether Hall. The hunt would move off and hunt fox coverts along the appropriately named Covert Lane to the east of the village towards Keyham.\nEducation: With no school in Scraptoft itself village children attended Thurnby St. Lukes School until the late 1960's when Somerby Road (Fernvale) School was opened, from there they went onto Oadby Manor High School and/or Gartree High School as middle school, followed by Beauchamp College at Oadby as senior and Upper School.\nDespite the village's close proximity to the City of Leicester, and its 21st century almost 'suburban' status, it still retains a semi-rural feel to it.\nScraptoft was recorded in the Domesday Book, as 'Scrapentot', as part of Gartree wapentake. It is said to be held by Coventry Abbey, and to have increased in value from 2 shillings at the time of the Conquest to 40 shillings to 1086.\nThe village is the site of various historic buildings including 'Scraptoft Hall', which is a listed building\nThe hall and its grounds were for many years used as a campus of De Montfort University and its predecessors, but was closed in 2003, this is to be redeveloped as a brown field site for housing, and is home to Peverill manor.\nThe village is host to the Scraptoft Golf Course.\nAnd the Peverill manor.
