{"prompt": "Context:\nIn Holly Black\u2019s dystopian take on the vampire tale, vampires no longer lurk in the shadows; they\u2019re making their existence known by infecting as many people as possible. Coldtowns-entire cities that are closed off and used to quarantine vampires and the infected- are developed to contain the threat. Behind their fortified walls, Coldtowns are completely lawless, run by the vampire gangs who control them. There are some people who enter Coldtown because they\u2019ve been bitten and have no other choice. Others go because Coldtown is known to be a 24 hour orgy of decadence and debauchery and they want to be invited to the party that never ends. No matter your reasons, once you enter, it\u2019s nearly impossible to leave.\n17 year old Tana Bach wakes up in a bathtub after a night of drinking at a house party to find everyone has been slaughtered by vampires. Everyone except her jerk of an ex-boyfriend Aidan who\u2019s been bitten and left tied to a bed and a strange, handsome boy with glinting red eyes named Gavriel who is bound in chains in the corner of the room. It\u2019s obvious to Tana that Gavriel is a vampire, but he clearly isn\u2019t the cause of the bloodbath. Gavriel is chained and weak but for some reason he\u2019s trying to help Tana (unlike Aidan who\u2019s trying to bite her). Whoever was responsible for the massacre is still in the house, waiting for sunset, which is fast approaching, to finish the job. Tana does what any self-respecting girl who finds herself in a room with her recently bitten ex-bf and a handsome vampire stranger would do, she vows to rescue them both and she manages to do it. But not without exposing herself to vampire venom in the process. The three set out for the only place vampires and soon to be vampires can go- Coldtown.\nAnyone who\u2019s spent any significant time in a car with other people knows that one road trip is the equivalent of weeks of casual hangouts. Especially when your ex-bf keeps trying to feed on your blood. In a strange role reversal it\u2019s the mysterious ancient vampire Gavriel who is protecting Tana from her lecherous, blood thirsty ex-bf Aidan instead of the other way around. The situation is perfect for a little on the road bonding between Tana and Gavriel.\nAs a reader I had a bit of a girl crush on Tana from the moment she resolutely decides she\u2019s doing the saving rather than waiting to be saved. Perhaps this is also the reason why Gavriel is immediately intrigued by this mortal girl who decides she is going to save the ancient vampire simply because it\u2019s the right thing to do. We later find out that Tana has reasons to be compassionate and Gavriel has reasons to appreciate kindness, but that comes later. Tana is also drawn to the mysterious boy with the beautiful lips and thick black lashes that fan his cheeks when he closes his ruby red eyes. And then there\u2019s Gavriel\u2019s voice. He is deadpan, wry, clever and speaks with a silky Russian accent (audiobook or inner monologue, you need the accent!) which is simply sexy. We learn that Gavriel has endured some recent trauma which has left him a touch mad (as in crazy) and causes him to speak in riddles at times. For instance, he offers to repay Tana\u2019s kindness with \u201cjewels, lies, slips of paper, dried flowers, memories of things long past, useless quotations, idle hands, beads, buttons, and mischief.\u201d Gavriel\u2019s poetic way of speaking only adds to his old world charm.\nGavriel is a fully fleshed out and perfectly flawed character. He isn\u2019t a perpetual teen, nor is he a wizened sage in a young body. As Tana points out, a vampire who\u2019s been alive as long as Gavriel does not age, instead he grows away from humanity. Gavriel is \u201cnot older than when he died; just entirely stranger\u201d. This is one of the best descriptions of the vampire age paradox I\u2019ve ever read. Spending time with Tana and Aidan on the road reminds Gavriel of the part of him that was put in suspended animation when he turned into a vampire. He travels to Coldtown with Tana and Aidan not because he has to, but because he wants to. It\u2019s like Gavriel took the day off from being an immortal to just be a teenager. I so wanted to go with him.\nHolly Black gives us a believable, imaginative and wholly additive world in The Coldest Girl in Coldtown. This book is a standalone, which is perfect. As much as I loved the characters and Gavriel\u2019s prose (I want a book of Gavriel poetry!), I couldn\u2019t think of a more perfect ending to this story. But if when you reach the end and you\u2019re still crazing more Coldtown, just do what I did. Read it again.\nAnn-Eliza\nOctober 30, 2015 at 8:25 am\nOmg omg shut up. I can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t read Holly Black in a long time, but books like Tithe still stick with me. This sounds amazing.

{"prompt": "Context:\nAfter.\nArriving first in Frankfurt we immediately took a local train (S-Bahn) for the 40-minute trip to Mainz. Note: We like Frankfurt. With its skyscrapers, it's the most American-looking city in Europe and a much more relaxed and interesting one than it used to be. But we know Frankfurt well and decided on Mainz this trip for a change of scenery.\nWe knew we had made a good decision when we were shown to our Hyatt Regency room with its view of the sun setting on the Rhine just yards away (meters, rather). As we hoped, Mainz proved to be a relaxing change of pace, with a population just a tenth that of bustling Paris. Mainz's mostly sunny weather also was a plus, along with its people and the maze of streets and shops in its \"old town\" -- in quotes because that district was largely destroyed in World War II and has been rebuilt in the image of what had existed before.\nWe found Mainz a pleasant and friendly city, although there are few attractions in the traditional tourist sense. Its twin-towered Dom is imposing even partially covered in scaffolding (per usual in Europe) but severe inside. The Gutenberg Museum is worth a visit for its bibles and history of printing. We watched a demonstration from a reproduction of Gutenberg's original press. One reviewer said he was bored there, but each to his own. Perhaps our favorite stop was St. Stephan's Church atop a steep hill, with its remarkable stained-glass windows by Marc Chagall. We also enjoyed walking along the Rhine promenade, watching the busy barge and tourist boats on the river.\nDining was good in Mainz. Different of course, but our dinners were as good as in Paris. Meals were in many cases lighter than you might think, and were accompanied by our favorite German rieslings. White asparagus was in season, usually accompanied by Hollandaise sauce. To our palates white asparagus is a lighter-tasting, more tender version of the green variety most familiar to Americans. We especially liked our plates of it in the garden at Zum Goldstein. The last night we ate at Wenke, a traditional Gaststube hometown cafe filled with locals happily downing beer and Wiener Schnitzel (OK, not light). We sat at a Stammtisch, a large table reserved for a group of regulars, who had canceled that night. We ate and chatted first with three older German ladies, then with a small group of younger German business people, one of whom worked for an American firm. It was a warm end to our time in Mainz.\nWe switched to the Steigenberger Airport hotel for our last two nights. The airport is about halfway between Mainz and Frankfurt. We wanted to be closer to our departure point and to spend a day in Frankfurt beforehand. While dining at the Unterschweinstiege restaurant that first night we mentioned our Frankfurt plans to the waitress. \"Oh,\" she said, \"but it's a national holiday and everything is closed!\" My wife's face fell: She had planned a shopping finale. But we went into Frankfurt the next day anyway. Big crowds!\nWere the shops not closed? They were. But the streets were filled with happy, not to say boisterous, Germans enjoying a wine festival supplemented by huge drafts of beer and wurst. Going further, in the pretty Roemerberg plaza we heard a big brass band and drinking songs, with steins being lifted by a mass of German fraternity men, many with white hair, wearing their traditional caps. We even posed for a photo at the altar of our St. Nicholas church on the Roemerberg, by the River Main, where we were married 46 years earlier. We had a great time. \"Everything is closed?\" Well, not everything. Check it out for yourself.\nFrankfurt Rhein-Main airport is an amazing city in itself, and we wished we had had time to take the offered tour before taking off. Maybe next time.\nMainz and Frankfurt: Rhein to the Main\nAfter.\nMainz' old town isn't large but it is exceptionally nice, especially along pedestrians-only Augustinerstrasse. Some of the old town including the buildings in the Kirschgarten square, date from the early 1500's:\nFor blocks and blocks around Market Square, autos are banned and pedestrians rule.\n(Oops - hit submit too soon.)\nAnyway, Mainz is a great place for strolling around.\nAnd there are actually quite a few museums in Mainz that may interest visitors:\nFor those wishing to overnight away from the airport, Mainz is great - direct trains run all day long starting at 4 am from Mainz to FRA and take about 20-25 minutes.\nWonderful report--and what an amazing treat to be able to return to the site of your wedding! Congrats!\nI grew to love Frankfurt too last summer and agree that it's a bit underappreciated. And Mainz was also great, as you detailed. I had much of the same impressions from the 3 main things I also saw--the Dom, Gutenberg Museum, and Chagall windows.\nGoing to Paris for the first time in about 3 weeks so I will read your other TR now--thanks!\nThe Alte Nikolai church is one of my favorite medieval churches in Frankfurt. How wonderful that you were married there! I bet that area looked a lot different 46 years ago then it does now.\nCongratulations on your anniversary!\nThanks for the report. Last time in Mainz we were fortunate enough to have one of the top floor rooms at the Hyatt with a balcony of sorts overlooking the river. Thought it was great place to stay and glad you enjoyed your own visit.\n\nUser question:\nWhat are some of the attractions and activities mentioned in the context that one can enjoy in Mainz?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nThe off-season focus is generally on player moves, designed to give each team a better chance to compete in future years. This off-season we not only have the player moves to focus on, but we also have the Collective Bargaining Agreement discussions between Major League Baseball and the Player\u2019s Union. Ken Rosenthal has an update on the CBA negotiations, which can be found at Fox Sports. The big items that impact the Pirates:\n-Major League Baseball wants to strike a deal during the upcoming World Series, although Rosenthal mentions there\u2019s a 50/50 chance of this happening. He also adds that both sides are more motivated to meet the target of the start of free agency, which begins five days after the World Series ends.\n-A big issue has been hard slotting in the draft, with the owners, specifically Bud Selig, wanting to implement this. Obviously hard slotting will hurt a team like the Pirates, who go to the extreme with over-slot deals. The Pirates spent more on the draft in the last four years than any other team, due to the lack of hard slotting, and adding a slotting system will hurt their chances to stockpile talent through the draft. It will prevent them from adding guys like Josh Bell for $5 M in the second round, as well as spending $1.2 M on ninth rounder Clay Holmes.\nRosenthal mentions that the two sides are far apart on the issue, but mentions that the two sides could come closer together. I\u2019m not sure if that means the players accepting hard slotting, or the owners giving up on that idea. Personally, it seems to me that Selig cares more about the PR benefits of announcing a deal during the World Series. That could be a benefit, as it provides less time to discuss the hard slotting issue.\n-The deal is expected to include a one game wild card round, adding a fifth playoff team in each league. It\u2019s also expected to include two 15-team leagues, with the Houston Astros being the most likely team to move from the NL to the AL. That can\u2019t happen until the new Astros\u2019 owner is approved.\n-There is also the chance that the new deal could include a provision for a World wide draft within a year. It\u2019s hard to say how this could affect the Pirates. In one hand, the current system benefits them, as they can sign guys like Luis Heredia as the top bidder (had there been a draft, Heredia could have gone to the Washington Nationals in 2010, as they would have had the first pick). On the other side of that, it really levels the inefficiency of the Japanese market. It would allow rebuilding teams the opportunity to get guys like Yu Darvish or Daisuke Matsuzaka, rather than seeing them go to big market teams like the Red Sox and Yankees.\nIdeally, for the Pirates, the deal won\u2019t include hard slotting. If small market teams have any shot to compete, it\u2019s through home grown talent. The best way to get that home grown talent is through the draft, and teams can increase the amount of talent by going over-slot on hard to sign prep players, and hoping that they develop in to first round caliber talents while in the farm system, rather than while they\u2019re in college.\nWould there be a seperate world wide draft or one big draft including HS, NCAA, and world? Also, the hard slotting is a joke. Why put a limit on what the Pirates can spend on a draft, when the Yankees/Red Sox have no limits on their roster?\nExactly. In one of the few areas where the small markets can compete and find value, Selig wants to shut them down. He wants to shut them down to protect owner profit, even if it means further hurting teams like the Pirates on the field.\nI don\u2019t think we will see an international draft. I don\u2019t think its even logistically feasible. The Leo Nunez incident shows how difficult it will be to implement. What happens when one team drafts Leo Nunez and another drafts Juan Carlos Oviedo? Who gets the one player with two names. What happens to teams that have developed academies for LA players? Do those teams get first right to draft those kids?\nHonestly, leave the international player system alone. Its another area where smart executives can take advantage of the system.\nIf Selig wanted to make the game more fair or competitive, he wouldn\u2019t go after hard slotting. There are only two reasons for Selig to go after the hard slotting process. The first and possibly the only reason is to keep costs down (with the by product improving owner profit). The other reason is to use it as a wedge or as leverage for some other issue.\nI think its the former rather than the latter. Selig cares mostly about owner profitability.\nMost of those ideas are dumb. I hate the idea that the relevance of divisions would be squashed by this, I hate the idea of an international draft, I don\u2019t think it will work, and I hate the idea of a hard slotting system. On the other hand, if there is a hard-slotting system, the upside will be that college baseball will be much more entertaining with all the talent that will be going there in lieu of going pro out of high school. That\u2019s a guarantee, and there will be even more from the U.S. going the college route if there\u2019s an international draft.\nAny talk about restructuring the compensation pick definitions? I haven\u2019t seen much, but it\u2019s not as high profile as the above.\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the major issue that has been discussed in the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations between Major League Baseball and the Player\u2019s Union?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nWrite code to test code\nOne of the job descriptions for my work these days is that \u201cI write code to test code\u201d. And this sounds so familiar.\nIn a recent book \u201cHow Google tests software\u201d, it is discussed in detail so as in what different ways Google engineers perform testing. The book is detailed and filled with practical experiences and it is not possible to explain the concept in this little window. But one thing is sure: almost every engineer there writes code to test code. Excerpts from Chapter 1 about the three dominant roles in engineering terms:\n\u201cSWEs (software engineers) write a lot of test code, including test-driven design (TDD), unit tests, \u2026\u201d\n\u201cSETs (software engineer in test) also spend close to 100 percent of their time writing code, but they do so in service of quality rather than coding features a customer might use.\u201d\n\u201cSome Google TEs (test engineers) spend a good deal of their time writing code in the form of automation scripts and code that drives usage scenarios and even mimics the user.\u201d\nIf I depict this picture as above where the numbered circles represent some engineer in a team, and that engineer may be totally focused on programming or testing activities, or it may have a mix.\nThe example from Google above means that they live by numbers 3, 5 & 4. (home work: relate these numbers with the roles mentioned above)\nSome teams are against the idea of dedicated testers and they live by number 1, 3 & 5.\nSome people are against the idea of \u201ctesters writing code\u201d, they live by the number 1 & 2. But beware as more and more testing jobs need programming skills.\nWhat are the numbers being used in your team? And how you think \u201cwrite code to test code\u201d is changing the numbers?\n11 responses to \u201cWrite code to test code\u201d\nTrackbacks / Pingbacks\n- September 30, 2013-\n- July 8, 2014-\n- October 21, 2014-\n- January 14, 2015-\nDevelopment Team writes code and Testing Team verifies code written by developers by writing their own code but who verifies the tester code?\nAre they always sure that the code written by testers are 100% correct?\nI have my own experience in this regard but I would like some testers to comment on this.\nThanks for your opinion and you are spot on Akif. It is one of the paradoxes of software testing also known as \u2018Who watches the watchman\u2019.\nThe code that testers write can also have bugs and when our tests start failing, it can be a problem with our test code or it can be a problem with production code as well. So these kind of issues come along as you know every thing in life is like a \u2018package\u2019 and not all good.\nThere are reasons though, where tester\u2019s code have less issues. 1) Testers are usually more conscious about quality 2) this layer is thin and 3) usually they follow a peer review mechanism. But still, \u2018no code is bug free\u2019 :)\nWriting code to test code works most of the time if you are prepared to accept that the likelihood of both developer and tester making a mistake at the same place will be close to zero. If either or both make non-overlapping mistakes a defect is sure to be found which can then be investigated. Of course if both make a mistake in the same place as a result of interpreting the specifications then you could raise a defect against the documentation on the basis that clarification is required; of course you have to detect the fault first!\nThanks Ali for reinforcement. You are right that if two thinking heads look to test the same stuff, chances of quality work are more.\nThis makes sense to me but still there are minimal chances of defects being left. As there is nothing called bug free software (please correct if I am wrong) so we can live with that and on the identification it can be fixed in the next iteration.\nEven though I have read, heard and experienced a lot on this issue, but as a test engineer my thoughts are still divided on the \u201cGoogle-Way\u201d of doing it. At one hand, I don;t want to let my test skills getting over shadowed by writing code in order to test a code. On the other hand, I don;t want test automation engineers to be the sole owner of automated test suites, and would prefer being on-board with the automation efforts. Writing test code is similar to writing piles and piles of documents to test an application;s functionality. Writing Test Specs and some 50+ pages of functional tests can probably make you a good documentation engineer, but test skills eventually start suffering and your documentation related issues get more focus than your test related issues (which should be your priority anyway). In either case, I am convinced that there has to be a balance. Yes, testers should be able to write code and document if needed, but this should not be their full-time focus.\nI was waiting for your such comments Huma :)\nYou are absolutely right in mentioning the importance of \u2018testing skills\u2019 and that\u2019s why we are not abandoning specialized testers. So what we want is that programmer try to learn some of these and hence step into Testing space. Similarly the proposal is that tester try to learn some of the programming skills and touch the Programming space.\nAlso agreed to your point of excessive test documentation time and I have some stuff ready on it. May be I should write a post dedicated on this topic of \u2018less documentation and more work\u2019.\n\nUser question:\nWhat are the three dominant roles in engineering terms according to the book \"How Google tests software\"?\n"}

Russell, 57 Cornhill,\nBoston 1886\nAlfred, the shire town of York County, is situated\nvery near the geographical centre of the county. It is on the Portland and Rochester Railroad, 32 miles from Portland.\nThe surrounding towns are Waterborough on the north and north-east, Lyman on the east, Shapleigh and Sanford on\nthe west, and Kennebunk and Sanford on the south. The town is about 12 miles long from north-west to south-east,\nand 4 miles wide at the middle, and contains 12,989 acres of land. The northern part is hilly, and abounds in granite\nrocks and hardwood forests, while the southern portion is comparatively level, with evergreen and hard woods. The\nsoil is a gravelly loam in higher lands and sandy loam on the plains. The chief eminence is Yeaton's Hill. The\ntown has good roads, and the general appearance of the buildings indicate thrift. The principal bodies of water\nare Shaker and Middle Branch, or Bungernuck Ponds, the first in the eastern and middle part of the town, and the\nlatter at the north. The principal streams are Hay Brook on the west, and the outlets of the pondsall running southward\nand joining with the Mousam River on the south-west. The manufactories are woollen, saw and grist mills at Littlefield's\nMills, and the Shaker's saw-mill. The business centres are Alfred Village, Littlefield's Mills, North Alfred and\nthe Shaker Village. The early history of the town is involved in that of Sanford, and it formerly bore the name\nof the \"North Parish of Sandford,\" and the Indian name of Massabesic. It was incorporated in 1794, being\nnamed in honor of Alfred the Great. The territory of the town was included in several quit-claim deeds purchased\nin 1761-4 of the Indian chiefs Fluellen, Hobinowell, and Captain Sunday, by Major William Phillips, of Saco.\nThe first settler was Simeon Coffin, who in 1764, dwelt for a time in an Indian wigwam, a few rods south-west of\nthe present residence of Colonel Ivory Hall. There were, at that time, several Indian families about Shaker Pond\nand the Hill. Other settlers soon followed. The first saw mill in town was built in 1766, by Charles and John White,\na Mr. Ellenwood, Thomas Kimball, Seth Peabody and Benjamin Tripe.\nIn 1782 a few families of Shakers settled at Moosebesic or Shaker Pond and Hill, and at Mastcamp, a few miles\nnorth. They were at this time, fanatical in religion and intemperate in their indulgences. They were organized\nas a body in their Present order and discipline in 1793. In 1782 a Congregational church was organized in Alfred,\nforming the North Parish of Sanford; but in revivals some became excited and joined the \"Merry Dancers\"\n(as the Shakers were then called), so that a minister was not settled until 1791. In 1834 the present house was\nerected, and an organ added in 1854. The Baptists built a church on the Back Road in 1818, and another at Littlefield's\nMills soon after 1855. A second church was organized at the Gore in 1841, and a church built there in 1847. The\nfirst permanent meeting of Methodists was in 1830, by Rev. John Lord, at the court-house; and in 1834 a church\nwas built. There is now an Advent Society also.\nAlfred became a half shire town in 1802; and a court-house was erected in 1807, which was remodelled and enlarged\nin 1852. The present fire-proof wings were finished in the fall of 1854. A log jail was built in 1803, and the\npresent stone jail in 1870. The town-house was erected in 1854, and burnt in 1861. The new one was luilt in 1862.\nThe Academy building was erected by private subscription in 1828. W. C. Larrabee was the first preceptor. It was\nkept in operation for some time each year until the erection of the graded school building in 1862. The High School\nis at Alfred village. There are now seven school-houses in the town, and the value of the school property is estimated\nat $5,500. The population in 1850 was 1,319; 1870, 1,224; 1880, 1,102.

{"prompt": "Context:\nThis is her, in the picture to the right. It's a shame the picture is as poor a quality as it is, as she's in a really nice looking pose here (There's a better picture at the end of the article). I apologize for that as the only thing I had at the time to take pictures was my cell phone. O, and don't let the for fool you, the tarantula is much bigger than the size comparison here shows. The fork is just magnified due to a\ncombination of the cage's glass angle and the lighting (actually....now that I look at it, thats a spatula). The little girl was actually about the size of my hand, minus the fingers. So not a huge tarantula, but not something I would want to get loose.\nWhen I first got her the idiot who had her before just threw all the meal worms he had into her cage. This meant that I had to go in and remove them while little missus (who never was to friendly) was inside the cage. This meant that my bare hands..and fingers, which to the tarantula we're remarkably similar in appearance to the meal worms, we're rummaging around within less than a foot of those beautiful gleaming fangs of heres. Needless to say, she made a few attempts to bite me, but for some reason failed to miss the mark, and i successfully removed all the meal worms. I'm told that a bite from a tarantula feels quite similar to a bee sting, which is harmless enough, but I would much rather avoid a bee sting if possible to. Now, you may be wondering why I had to get those meal worms out. Well the reason is that the worms eat anything, and everything, including the little girl with huge fangs that was intended to eat them, if she was ever to say...sleep...or molt.\nMolt she did, much later than the worm incident mind you, but she did molt. You might be thinking, well...why is she upside down in this next picture? Isn't she dead? Well, no actually, this is how they start a molt, by flipping upside down. It's a good thing I looked it up instead of assuming she died to, because I'm sure I would have disposed of her sooner rather than later, and not had a chance to find out what was really going on!\nUpon closer inspection she was twitching her legs. this went on for about twenty minutes until the top of her separated (in this case the part currently facing down). She then slowly pulled her body out of it's former shell, pulling the fangs, and legs with her. As she did this she changed from completely upside down, to facing sideways (as is depicted in the picture to the right). The fangs where the first appendage to be completely removed. After that, she managed to work free her bottom. At this point about an hour had past. The picture to the right shows the tarantula about half way out of her old exoskeleton.\nIn case your wondering; yes, the removal of the legs took approximately another full hour to complete. Let me tell you, it did not look like a comfortable hour either for the poor girl. She was basically hog tied and unable to move, her old exoskeleton acting like a harness around her legs. She did of course, manage to get free. After the molt, she laid there for a good ten minutes upside down, I guess resting. I didn't get a chance to see her turn upside down, or right herself, so I have no clue how she did it. I came home to her upside down, and looked away for two seconds after the molt and she had righted herself. The best part of the whole thing is, that after the molt, instead of being a dull brown, she changed colour to a vibrant navy blue. I of course tried to take a video, but realized it was going to be incredibly long, and you couldn't make out much of the video anyways.\nThe tarantula is now safe at a classmates house, and if anyone is considering getting one as a pet, I strongley suggest it, as they only really require a few crickets a week, and water, and thats it for maintenance besides a yearley change of their substrate.\nO!, and look at what I found on my computer! another picture (courtesy of my fianc\u00e9es camera). This time much better one of her. as you can see, she's a rather plain colour of brown. Like I mentioned earlier though, after the molt she turned a nice navy blue colour. She was an Nicaragua Zebra Tarantula, and not the more common Costa Rican type. The difference is that the Costa Rican type is black, while the Nicaragua type is brown. That begs the question of where the blue came from.

Here I wish to discuss a more difficult question: the reason for performing certain screening tests. Again, let me emphasize that I am only talking about how a given screening test benefits the individual, and not how performing the test on the individual would benefit society. Whether or not an individual patient should submit to (and possibly pay for) a test that the doctor knows would only benefit society and not the patient is an interesting philosophical and ethical question, but that discussion is outside the scope of this blog. Needless to say the question of cost-effectiveness will not enter into my discussion, since if I am restricting myself to the direct benefit to the patient, the ultimate cost to society should be outside my purview. For the sake of this discussion, I will also assume that the test is 100 per cent accurate, with no false positives or negatives. I realize that this assumption is similar to assuming a straight line has no width, but the minute we admit the existence of errors in screening tests, the discussion has to include statistical probabilities as well as the incidence of the disease being screened for, and I am trying to keep this presentation as uncluttered as possible. I am also deliberately omitting any discussion of the optimum interval between tests, since there is virtually no hard data on this point for any test.\nThe problem, of course, with this minimal set of assumptions, is that we now have a reason for doing any test for which there is a treatment that can avert morbidity or death. A chest Xray could show unsuspected tuberculosis, a blood test could show unsuspected mercury poisoning, and an EKG could show a regular rhythm with unsuspected 2:1 block. Again, we are not interested in the probabilities of these diseases, but only with finding them. And of course if you asked the patient if he/she wanted to be tested for TB or elevated Hg+ or a cardiac arrhythmia, the answer would be \"yes\" in all instances. And if you as the patient's doctor knew in advance that a certain test would demonstrate a treatable condition, you would be morally and legally wrong not to order the test. So how do doctors decide which tests to do or not to do?\nUnfortunately for the purist, this is where statistical probabilities and the doctor's diagnostic acumen and level of disease suspicion enter. Should every patient dwelling in the northeastern United States or certain other geographical areas have a western blot test for Lyme disease and babesiosis? Should every sexually active patient be tested for syphilis and HIV? Should every woman of child-bearing age receive a blood test for pregnancy before every Xray? Since at autopsy 10% of males at age 40 have coronary artery disease should every male have a stress-thallium at this age? Should everyone have a flexible sigmoidoscopy (which requires virtually no cleanout, unlike a colonoscopy) at age 30 to look for colon cancer? Shouldn't everyone have a skin test for tuberculosis? Shouldn't everyone receive an echocardiogram to look for IHSS and an abdominal USG to look for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?\nAfter the tests are done, we then have methodological questions: At what level of fasting glucose should we label a patient as \"pre-diabetic\"? At what level of fasting glucose should we start pharmacological treatment, and what glucose level should be our goal? Since the risk of stroke and heart disease increases monotonically with systolic blood pressure, at what number should we start to treat blood pressure, and to what number do we wish to reduce it? To what number should the cholesterol be lowered? If we start to treat a patient, how often should the patient be retested? When a government-sponsored panel of doctors makes a health recommendation, why aren't we told the vote? (I am much more confident in following a 19-1 vote than a 12-8 vote.) And why aren't we told the arguments of the doctors who disagreed with the public health recommendation the way we are when the FDA recommends approval of a drug? And do the doctors who voted against the recommendation of the majority of the panel change the way they practice medicine to conform to the recommendation of the panel, even if they think the panel is wrong?\nI hope this blog serves in part to show that there is an art of judgment in medicine. In today's topic the judgment lies in deciding which tests to order and which not to order. There is also another art of judgment when the test results come back: how \"abnormal\" does a blood test or Xray have to be in order to influence the treatment plan of the physician?\nSunday, June 24, 2012\nMedical Screening Tests\nPosted by george thomas at 6:09 PM\nLabels: Medical Screening Tests\n\nUser question:\nWhat factors influence a doctor's decision on which medical screening tests to order or not to order?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nHakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi: Fall in Love like a Samurai\nby November 14, 2013 at 8:00 amon\nSections: 2D, 3DS, Adventure, Developers, Exclusives, Game-Companies, Genres, Handhelds, Originals, Publishers, Reviews\nSections: 2D, 3DS, Adventure, Developers, Exclusives, Game-Companies, Genres, Handhelds, Originals, Publishers, Reviews\nHakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi is the 3DS port of the PSP game of the same name from Idea Factory and Aksys Games. An Otome (dating Sim) in visual novel form. It is the most recent release in the Hakouki series of Otome games and anime series dating back to the PS2. As an Otome, it very much geared towards female players, and as a visual novel it\u2019s more about reading than playing. Don\u2019t let that scare you off however, because despite it\u2019s extremely narrow target audience, there is a lot more beneath the surface than you might expect.\nLove in the time of Samurai and Demons.\nIn fact for a game who\u2019s goal is ostensibly to choose the dreamiest samurai and make him fall in love with you, Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi is shockingly dark and compelling. There are demons, and genetically engineered vampire super soldiers, political intrigue, mystery, and devastating warfare. The story is completely at odds with the underlying mechanics of the game.\nGraphically, Haku\u014dki: Memories of the Shinsengumi honestly doesn\u2019t have much to offer. Its predominantly still images of serviceable but slightly dull artwork. The characters are well done enough, but backgrounds are re-used far too often. Still, for the purpose they get the job done. The 3D effects are actually pretty nice, considering its all still images. The is subtle, but just enough to give the otherwise plain artwork some pop. I actually spent more time with the 3D turned on in Haku\u014dki than in probably any other 3DS game I\u2019ve played.\nIt is much the same in the sound department. Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi doesn\u2019t really feature much of anything in sound effects, and the voice acting is all in Japanese. The voice work is very well done and leaving it in Japanese does help keep the authentic mood of the game quite nicely. Musically there isn\u2019t much to talk about, the soundtrack is mostly mellow, classic Japanese music that sort of disappears after a while. Again, while not outstanding, the music does its job of maintaining the feel of the game and not standing out as a destruction to your reading. It tends to be rather relaxing in fact which is great for just sitting back and falling into the story, but don\u2019t expect any outstanding, memorable scores here.\nTurn the page\nSince it is a visual novel, the story is really the most important part of the game, and on this front Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi does not disappoint. The localization to English is utterly flawless, huge kudos to Aksys for translating so much text so perfectly. The game does tend to get dragged down into some excessive detail about minor things, and some of the dialogue is rather awkward, but the bigger picture is what really matters here.\nThe story of a young girl, who secretly has Wolverine-style healing abilities, disguising herself as a boy and taking off across Japan to find her lost father winds up being a lot better than I ever expected from this game. After being chased down by some Ronin, and then beset upon by some sort of Vampire demons, you soon find yourself living amongst a feared group of Samurai called the Shinsengumi, and who also seem to be intimately familiar with the aforementioned demons. Throughout the story, Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi will delve into everything from Japanese Imperial politics, to the morality of genetic engineering. For a game that\u2019s supposed to be about you trying to hook up with the cutest samurai, I couldn\u2019t believe how dark the story was, and how much I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. It\u2019s almost disconcerting when the game reminds you that you\u2019re supposed to be falling in love with one of these guys.\nUnfortunately things start off really slow, I mean really, really slow, so it\u2019s hard to get into at first. It takes a while for the plot to really grab hold and start to go anywhere, but once it picks up the pace, it gets to be rather entertaining. I should note that I did a terrible job and got the \u201cworst\u201d ending, because I wasn\u2019t actually trying to chase after a guy, but rather I kept doing what seemed the most rational choice for any given situation. Don\u2019t do that, it doesn\u2019t end well.\nDemonically Delightful\nUltimately Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi is a difficult game to recommend to anyone not already a fan of the genre because it starts off so slow, offers essentially zero gameplay in the traditional sense, and while there is replayability, you need to get halfway through the game before anything really changes.. That being said, for fans of the visual novels it does a pretty solid job. I found the story rather enjoyable, even though it tends to get a bit bogged down in the minutia of how dreamy so-and-so\u2019s eyes are, but it is a dating sim after all. So long as you know the kind of niche game this is, and are fully aware of what you are getting into with it, Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi is great at what it does.\nRelated Articles\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the main genre of the game Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nOr What Do Half-Drunk Hungarian Peasants and French Day-Trippers Share with Homer?\n.\nI\u2019m not particularly into music history but I believe volumes have been written about the spread of folk songs, sailors\u2019 shanties, etc. across the Atlantic and there is in fact nothing remarkable about the song being known both to the French and the Americans. Witnessing evidence for this first hand though was another thing altogether; especially because the kids experienced folk music \u2013 the way it\u2019s meant to be \u2013 for the first time.\nAbout Folk Music and Music Education\nWhen I was a kid, I was taught folk music in school. In Hungary folk music is the beginning and the end, the alpha and omega of music education; in the land of Kod\u00e1ly and Bart\u00f3k folk music is a sacred cow and the only way to teach music is by drawing from a \u201cclean source\u201d (ie. folk music).\nIn Hungary toddlers are taught rhythm by clapping and tune by hand-signs, and every child, even if tone-deaf like myself, leaves primary school with the ability to sing on sight from a sheet. I acknowledge my debt to the Kod\u00e1ly method but I do remember how dreary we used to think folk music, degraded to a compulsory school subject. (On the other hand, in England music education consists of teaching children snatches of West End musicals, often singing lyrics that are highly inappropriate in mouths of under-10s. But perhaps it\u2019s just me who cringes as 7-year-olds render songs from Jesus Christ Superstar at an infant school\u2019s Nativity play.)\nI\u2019ve heard some great traditional songs on recordings. I\u2019ve been to some great concerts listening to folk musicians who really knew what they were about. But I always came away with a feeling of having been somehow robbed: a crucial ingredient always gets lost. It\u2019s music played by trained musicians and (barring its origins) it\u2019s got nothing to do with us \u2018folks\u2019. Not like French holiday makers singing together on a boat just for the fun of it. Not like that evening in my aunt\u2019s overcrowded kitchen, when I was about 8 or 9 and the family, three generations, gathered together for some forgotten occasion, and with the red wine and the talk flowing freely somebody started to sing. One by one the adults joined in, and my uncle brought out his zither. That was folk music: untrained voices, joining together, sharing something. Red faces, bright eyes, laughter, much banging on the table and half-sentences shouted over the twang of the zither, while the music and the singing got progressively worse as the evening wore on and the effects of the wine began to tell.\nHomer and the Oral Tradition\nI was thinking about this, about folk music, and about what a difference it makes to take part in it as opposed to merely studying it because of what I\u2019ve been reading in The Mighty Dead \u2013 the book I\u2019m about halfway through \u2013 about the oral tradition and how this may give us an insight into Homer.\nHomer vs Academia\nPeople try to read the Iliad today, or the Odyssey, and as often as not are confronted with convoluted language, forced into dactylic hexameters. In lauded scholarly editions the introduction is often longer than the epic itself and the mountain of notes at the back of the book is enough to scare away even the most eager readers. The famous Homeric epithets bore today\u2019s readers to death, because after all how many times do you really need to hear that Achilles is swift-footed and does Apollo really need to be constantly called \u201cgod of the silver bow\u201d, nice as the phrase might be?! But these phrases are aide-m\u00e9moires, ready-made building blocks to fit the dactylic hexameter. The Iliad and Odyssey were not meant to be read in solitary comfort on a sofa.\nThere was a time in history, the time of Homer, presumably, as well as the centuries that went before and after, when the Iliad or the Odyssey were not merely an academic exercise. Unlike today, they were not just the territory of university professors indulging in self-serving discussions on the merits of each line or bickering over whether Homer was one man or more, killing the epic story in dry scholarly analyses. There was a time when the themes on which the Iliad and the Odyssey are developed were shared by ordinary people, when everybody knew the fundamentals of the stories. In the fifth and fourth century B.C., travelling storytellers, rhapsodes, performing the Iliad and the Odyssey were part of life in Greece. And so these stories were told and retold, sang by the rhapsodes, changed and shaped slightly differently in each telling. Not everyone can (re)tell a story well, much less make one up on the spot no matter how familiar with its elements, but everybody can listen, and a travelling storyteller can and will, if he wants to make a good living, adapt his story to his audience\u2019s perceived likes and needs. And much like the interaction between the actors and the groundlings in Shakespeare\u2019s Globe makes a play more alive, more memorable and wholly unique and unrepeatable, so this manner of performing made the Iliad and the Odyssey alive, memorable and unique.\nStep back from the book and see in your mind the rhapsode in his travelling cloak, with his staff in hand, singing out to a crowd of random listeners in the bustling agora to earn his dinner. Imagine watching several of them perform in competitions, one after another, each desperately trying to trump the previous singer.\nHomer, admirable in all respects\u2026\n(Aristotle: Poetics)\nI don\u2019t really care if Homer was one man or more. I don\u2019t really care if there never was a man called Homer. What I do care about is the stories. The way they are taught in schools (when they\u2019re taught at all) they seem dead and boring \u2013 nothing to do with us today. But these stories didn\u2019t survive thousands of years by being bad. I happen to like the way the Iliad has been told by Homer, epithets and all. Not everybody does. But you don\u2019t have to read Homer to enjoy the story of the Trojan War or the wanderings of Odysseus. They\u2019ve been told and retold time and again, sometimes focusing on this episode, sometimes on that. Take the story and turn it into your own. Like with folk music, it\u2019s all about being immersed in it. And then someday you might want to come to Homer for his take on the story.\nMaybe that\u2019s how we should introduce children to Homer: tell them the stories, give them a list of epithets and let them retell their favourite bits, making it up as they go along. Like that Budapest folk musician did above when he put the bow in the children\u2019s hands. It\u2019s all part of the folk process, after all.\n\nUser question:\nHow is music education approached in Hungary according to the context?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nBUSINESS RULES\nby Bruce Silver\nMajor IT initiatives may be a tough sell in this economy, but many\norganizations are investing in order to meet government mandates and\ncompetitive threats. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct and UCCnet are two examples of market forces driving adoption of new technology.\nSurrounded by the rubble of the New Economy meltdown, advocates of e-business\ntransformation have increasingly seen the life snuffed out of their once \"mission-critical\"\nprojects by the CFO's new litmus test: Can you guarantee me return on investment in twelve\nto eighteen months?\nThe age-old technology promises of faster, better and cheaper ring hollow in today's\nworld of fear, uncertainty and doubt. No one disputes that replacing paper documents with\nelectronic data, manual processes with automation, or proprietary formats and protocols\nwith open Internet standards will probably eventually lower costs, increase agility and\neven improve service to customers, but today, who can afford to think about the eventual\nor even the probable? IT investment now requires immediacy and certainty of result, not\ncrossing a no-man's-land of competing half-baked technology standards or relying on\nhigh-tech partners who could be in Chapter 11if not in jailany day now.\nStill, e-business is succeeding, in isolated pockets, propelled over the CFO's hurdle\neither by government mandates or the progress of direct competitors. Now that the go-go\ndays are gone, these two Old Economy pressures, one coming from government and the other\nfrom the free market, are defining the new e-business landscape.\nA good example of a government mandate is HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act, passed in 1996 during the upswing of the internet revolution but just\nnow finalizing its regulatory requirements. HIPAA represents a revolutionary standardization\nof medical informationhow it is encoded and transmitted electronically, how it is secured\nand how its privacy is maintaineda massive IT investment affecting all insurers, hospitals,\nphysicians, even pharmacies and labs.\nWhile reduced administrative costs are the carrot, the investment driver is really the stick.\nOnce the regulations are finalized, most health plans and providers must comply within two years\nor face stiff fines. That clock is about to start.\nThe healthcare industry, cash-strapped even back in bubble days, has seized upon the compliance\nmandate to justify a wholesale IT upgrade. A survey of large hospitals early this year found\nthat nearly 70 percent of them are using HIPAA compliance as the hook for introducing new\ncomputer technology and best practices hospitalwide.\nMandates can be shaped by industry itself. An example from the Securities Industry Association\nis called T+1, referring to the settlement of securities trades within one day of the actual trading\ndate instead of the current three days. T+1 is really just one objective of a broader movement called\nstraight-through processing (STP), automation of front- and back-office business processes cutting\nacross company lines in many segments of financial services.\nIn pre-recessionary times, T+1 promised to increase trading volumes while reducing credit risk,\nand the way was paved for mandated compliance (backed by SEC regulation) by 2005. Now, however, to\nmost securities firms the cost seems to outweigh the benefits. In July, the SIA decided to put T+1\naside for now and re-evaluate in two years, while encouraging work on other, more narrowly focused\nSTP initiatives.\nA very different kind of pressure for e-business transformation is simply incremental adoption\nof new systems and standards by key competitors. An example of that is UCCnet, a\nnot-for-profit-sponsored service offering data synchronization and a global registry of product\ninformation for retailers and their consumer packaged goods suppliers. Without UCCnet, a simple\ncan of Campbell's soup has a different product name, description, pricing and promotion data in\nthe database of every supermarket chain that sells it. That means manual data entry to patch over\nthe differences whenever new information comes out from the supplier. By acting as a middleman,\nUCCnet claims it can \"increase quality purchase orders by 30 percent, increase speed-to-shelf for\nprice changes and new products by 80 percent, and raise point of sale scanning accuracy to 99.8\npercent.\"\nThat's the old hookfaster, better, cheaperbut with real industry adoption. Two original\npilot partners, Ralston Purina and Wegmans Food Markets, converted to UCCnet after the pilot. Kraft\nFoods and Shaw's Supermarkets started using it as well, as did giant chains Ahold USA and Wal-Mart.\nThe tipping point is when other companies fear being left behind by their competitors. It's a\ndifferent kind of stimulus than a mandatemore speculative in the beginning, more certain in\nthe end.\nIt's not surprising that suppliers of business process management, content management, and\nrelated platform technologies are now offering specific solutions for HIPAA, STP and UCCnet\nin their search for ready-to-buy customers. These scattered initiatives seem to be the model\nfor the new New Economynot radical new business models, but industry-wide adoption\nof new systems and standards by established companies. Sometimes mandates are required,\nsometimes adoption flows incrementally out of pilots that work.\nIt's a conservative plan for a conservative time. |\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and how does it affect the IT investment in the healthcare industry?\n"}

It was an event that I knew in my heart would come to pass; however the odds against the group\u2019s very survival have been great.\nParamahansa Yogananda taught that nothing is sent to us that we cannot handle, and it is something I often bring to mind in times of seeming adversity. Firstly we had to find a suitable venue for the group, which was growing rapidly and wasn\u2019t as straight forward as we thought. That was because I was trying to arrange it myself, rather than waiting for Divine Mother\u2019s intervention. But then, relaxing into the flow once again, the way opened and we were kindly offered the use off the hospital chapel where I work.\nInevitably perhaps, the initial enthusiasm of some of the members began to wane and some we lost altogether. People come and people go, but all will have been touched by Guru\u2019s vibration and received what they were capable of receiving, according to their karma and level of spiritual development. It has been a wonderful lesson in practicing non attachment to the fruit of our labours. It could have been all too easy to take rejection as a personal affront.\nAs the group began to establish itself some members could not deal with the meetings gearing more toward devotion to our line of gurus. That was fine and their decision to make, but I wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise on the true purpose of an Ananda Meditation Group just to put more \u2019bottoms on seats\u2019. Contrastingly, I witnessed 2 sincere members undergo great emotional healing of long standing problems, both on a profound level and after only a few weeks of meditation.\nSo our numbers are few, and not surprising on a small island. We do have, what I call, \u2018satellite\u2019 members who either live too far away, or cannot get to our meetings for various reasons, who like to stay connected by receiving the Group News letter each week. I am always available for advice to these members who strive to build an effective meditation practice on their own. The main Ananda website offers great support for those who want to deepen their practice, whether struggling alone or in a group, and now even offers \u2018virtual\u2019 webinars.\nDivine Mother continued to play Her hand as circumstances then led to my being taken away from the Island and not being able to lead the group some weeks. I was away on the UK mainland frequently (and still am) to attend to the needs of my sister who is very sick, but my conscience against letting the group and gurus down was appeased knowing the group was in the safe hands of a sincere devotee, or so I thought until she badly broke her leg shortly after I had received the news of my sister\u2019s illness. Rendered immobile for a good while, we moved the meditation venue to her home so she could still attend.\nNot to be deterred, we strove to maintain a steady stream of energy flowing through the group, even if it meant only one person keeping the flow moving by meditating alone some weeks. We have the faith that God is taking care of everything and that, like all new ventures on The Path, we are all being tested. The group itself is being tested.\nAnd so it was such a joy to be able to see the group\u2019s first anniversary; hanging in there against all odds. And what better way to celebrate than with our first Discipleship Ceremony.\nSon-in law, Ben and dear friend, Liz both took their vow in view of progressing to Kriya initiation next year at an Ananda centre.\nThe energy of our guru\u2019s was tangible throughout the ceremony. As we chanted \u2018Jai Guru\u2019, the very ether was supercharged with cosmic energy. I knew that God was smiling upon us this day, as He has been throughout all the karmic trials we, individually and as a group, are working our way through. He has never left our hearts and is ever more strongly present as we emerge from our trials out the other side, unscathed, strengthened and ever more determined to put our guru\u2019s teachings into practice.

If those women are old, what in the hell am I?\nSo, now that I\u2019m thoroughly depressed, I think I\u2019ll go ahead and turn in, and see if I can manage to sleep through my own strange sleep noises.\nImage courtesy of Stuart Miles at FreeDigitalPhotos.net\nA very short post tonight, because it\u2019s almost 6:00am, and I haven\u2019t been to bed yet. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019ve got way too much homework to do. And, incidentally, I think I\u2019m getting way too old for these all-nighters!\nAnd, I probably really shouldn\u2019t be pulling all-night sessions on the day I\u2019m supposed to be talking about my health and well-being, since I\u2019m pretty confident that sleep deprivation isn\u2019t on anybody\u2019s list of things you ought to be doing.\nAnyway, there are just a couple of things that have been on my mind lately. First, for a couple of weeks or so now, I\u2019ve been taking those green coffee bean extract pills. Anyone else tried them? They\u2019re supposed to be great for weight loss. (Yeah, I would so take any pill that seemed safe that would help me lose weight.) Anyway, I think the jury is still out for me. They haven\u2019t really helped me lose weight, but I will say they seem to help keep my weight pretty stable, even when I\u2019m eating terribly, so I guess that\u2019s a plus. They\u2019re kind of expensive, but I think I\u2019ll keep taking them for at least another month, and see how it goes. Oh, and I haven\u2019t noticed any side effects at all.\nSecond, as long as we\u2019re talking about miracle weight loss approaches, I\u2019ve been thinking about those body toning wraps. I\u2019ve known a couple of people who\u2019ve tried them and say they actually do seem to work, but I just can\u2019t wrap my head around it. I guess my thing is that I could almost believe it would dehydrate a specific body part or something, to give you some sort of immediate visible results, but I can\u2019t figure out how it could possibly have any long-term effect. Unless you just kept doing it every few days for the whole rest of your life, of course. But talk about expensive!\nStill, those are the sorts of things I\u2019m wondering about these days, if there\u2019s any little added boost that can help me get jump started again. I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed. And if you know of any wonder-secrets, do let me know, won\u2019t you?\nThis.\nYesterday,..\nHome repair, lunch, homework, Firefly marathon.\nImage courtesy of David Castillo Dominici at FreeDigitalPhotos.net\nLink up with Cate and share your six words.\nWell,.\nTomorrow,.\nWell,?\nSniffing and sneezing\u2014downside of spring.\nImage courtesy of Stuart Miles at FreeDigitalPhotos.net.\nImage.\nThis week on Tube Day Tuesday, it\u2019s a short trip down memory lane.\nThis morning, for no reason I can fathom, I was thinking about an old show called The San Pedro Beach Bums. It was a goofy little show that I barely remember, but I do remember being amused by it. It only lasted a couple of months, so I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t really all that good. Of course, I never have been much of a comedy person, so maybe I\u2019m just not that good at picking them.\nBut, since I was thinking about that short-lived show, it got me to wondering what other comedies might have crossed my path in my youth. Well, really, there were quite a few of them: Mork and Mindy, Happy Days, The Partridge Family, The Brady Bunch, The Monkees . . . and probably many more. Maybe this whole anti-comedy thing is newer than I thought.\nBut, those were all successful shows, nothing like those beach bum boys, so I wondered what else I\u2019d watched that crashed and burned really quickly, and one show immediately sprang to mind: When Things Were Rotten.\nImage courtesy Wikipedia Commons\nEven if you\u2019re not familiar with the program\u2014which wouldn\u2019t be surprising, since it aired only 13 episodes way back in 1975\u2014you can probably guess from the photo that it was show about Robin Hood. I wasn\u2019t even quite a teenager yet when this show was on the air, and I still remember thinking it was absolutely hysterical.\nCreated by Mel Brooks, and starring Dick Gautier, this was not your typical telling of the Robin Hood legend. Here you had over the top slapstick comedy about a band of total idiots running wild in Sherwood Forest, making you wonder how they ever survived. But, of course, the answer is because the Sheriff of Nottingham was an even bigger fool, making the merry men appear almost heroic by contrast.\nI can remember cackling at some of their antics, though I\u2019m not really much of a Brooks fan. Honestly, that kind of broad humor pretty much leaves me cold these days, and it has for a lot of years. But, apparently, when I was 12, it was just the ticket. Sight gags, stupid puns, and characters talking to the camera, they all made me LOL decades before we\u2019d ever dream up such an abbreviation. I wish I could see it again, because I can\u2019t really remember the details all that clearly. I\u2019d like to get them refreshed. Though, I might be just a tiny bit scared that seeing the episodes now would ruin my memories. I seem to remember it got pretty good reviews, but good reviews don\u2019t always mean a good or successful television program. I guess some things really never change.\nOne of these days, maybe it\u2019ll hit Netflix, or somebody will decide the episodes ought to be on DVD. Until then, I guess I\u2019ll just have to be content with my memories, however vague they may be.\nAre there any shows that came and went quickly in your childhood that you still remember fondly?\nI\nWell,.\n\nUser question:\nWhat are the two weight loss methods the author has been considering?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nAustralopithecus afarensis, of which AL-288-1* was a member, lived between 3.9-2.9 million years ago and was fairly adept at walking upright. Whilst not as good at being bipedal as later species, such as Homo sapiens, they could still walk well.\nHowever, whilst their anatomy was adapted for upright walking, they still retained some characteristics that would also allow them to be good climbers. Their fingers, for example, are curved like a modern ape\u2019s.\nThus the question arises \u2013 did they mostly climb or walk? Did they merely traverse between groups of trees, where they spent most of their time climbing, or did they only retreat into the canopy for safety from predators; or is there something else going on entirely?\nThese footprints were left behind by Au afarensis 3.5-3.5 mya. Just think about that.\nNew Scientist suggests a soon to be published paper may provide some answers to this mystery, although I\u2019m not so sure.\nThe research in question focused on Guinea chimpanzees which were discovered to nest on the ground more frequently than other troupes had been recorded doing (14% of their nests were on the ground versus 5%). This would suggest that chimps will nest on the ground despite the fact they lack fire (for now) or other tools to fend of predators, which in turn opens up a range of options for Au. afarensis.\nMight they too have nested on the ground? Could their tree climbing features merely be vestigial then? There\u2019s a range of interesting possibilities here.\nHowever, this train of thought \u2013 the one New Scientist seems to be taking \u2013 suffers from a fatal flaw which threatens to derail the whole thing: The jungle in which this group of chimps live has very few predators in it. Now, this makes sense; after all, why would the chimps be putting themselves in a more vulnerable position if there are things to exploit them? But it also means that applying this logic to Australopithecus is only valid if they too live in an environment with few predators.\nWhich doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Hominins, after all, were living on the increasingly open Savannah type environment. It would not have been a safe place for them, so camping out on the ground seems to be an unlikely option.\nSome chimp groups have been seen to nest on the ground despite their being some predators in the area, but the frequency with which this happened is lower than the troupe studied (10% versus 14%).\nFurther, the citation for this figure is both in Dutch and under an embargo until November this year so I have no way of finding out how frequent predation is.\nEven if it is more often than for the group under investigation, is it similar to what hominins were experiencing? If not then these findings still wouldn\u2019t be applicable to them. At best this research suggests hominins would\u2019ve slept on the ground prior to predator defeating technology if there were no predators.\nBut who said they were safe in trees?\nSo the implications for human evolution aren\u2019t especially valid. So doesn\u2019t this render the research useless?\nHardly, it\u2019s an interesting paper that\u2019s trying to answer a puzzling question in its own right: why do the chimps sleep on the ground? There are perfectly good trees for them to nest in nearby, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nOne hypothesis was that it was a form of mate guarding \u2013 it is mostly males who sleep on the ground, perhaps they are doing it to protect their mates in the nearby trees from rivals.\nHowever, this research uses a rather clever genetic trick (or at least I think it\u2019s clever, but I know little about genetics so it might not be) to demonstrate that the chimps sleeping on the ground are closely related to those in the nearby trees.\nAs such, they wouldn\u2019t be mating to the tree-dwelling chimps so the \u201cmate guarding\u201d hypothesis can be dismissed. And so the question of why they sleep up there remains.\nIt\u2019s just one big happy family\nThat is, in my opinion, more interesting (and accurate) than the relevance of this study to human evolution. However, this angle is hidden by New Scientist\u2019s focus on how this research pertains to hominins and the best part of the research lost.\nOf course, it isn\u2019t entirely their fault; the paper itself also tries to tie this work into human evolution. Quite why I do not know, the research is fascinating without trying to tart it up by linking in humans.\nTake that away and you\u2019re left with an interesting, creative paper. Unfortunately, we\u2019re also left with two rather puzzling mysteries. How arboreal was Australopithecus and why aren\u2019t these chimps sleeping in the trees?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n*I\u2019m going to start calling Lucy Al-288-1 (unless I feel lazy).

{"prompt": "Context:\nYou hate to cook, and if there\u2019s not something healthy readily available, you end up eating junk. The good thing is if those healthier foods are available, you\u2019ll choose them over junk every time.\nConsequently, you almost always end up getting \u201chealthy\u201d take-out. Often it\u2019s from Chipotle, Trader Joe\u2019s or Whole Foods, and you even tried a local food-delivery service. Though this has helped you eat cleaner, it\u2019s not sustainable for your budget long-term.\nYou know you need to take off the training wheels: stop relying on pre-made meals and learn to make your own healthy dishes. But your lack of kitchen skills and distaste for cooking means the solution has to be simple.\nBelieve it or not, this is a common scenario for both my readers and coaching clients.\nHealthy Kitchen Time-Savers:\nMeal template, not recipes\nFollowing a recipes takes longer and is more complicated for the basic reason that you have to translate words into actions. Instead, define templates for each meal of the day that you can loosely follow.\nFor example, your breakfast template could be a green smoothie. The ingredients may vary day-to-day and seasonally, but you always know what you are making.\nFor lunch, your template could be a monster salad. You throw in a cup of beans or quinoa and whatever veggies you have on hand and top it with a delicious but healthy dressing. Check out my Sweet and Tangy dressing (just 2 ingredients!), straight out of my cookbook. Or check out these 10 ideas for salad dressings you probably already own.\nYour dinner template could be a Buddha bowl \u2013 1/2 cup beans, 1/2 cup quinoa, millet, or buckwheat, at least a cup of cooked veggies, and another delicious sauce (I\u2019ve been known to use the \u201csalad dressings\u201d in the above article).\nBy following these templates, you never have to wonder what you\u2019re making. You just throw in the ingredients you have on hand and eat.\nCook a big pot of beans and grains on Sunday\nAs the basis for the above meal templates during the week, it helps to have your core calorie sources, aka beans and grains, cooked in advance and ready to go when you need them.\nI cook a few days worth of beans in a crockpot overnight then store it for the week in the fridge. When I make grain for any meal, I always make at least a quadruple portion and store the extras.\nIf you want to get fancier, chop up veggies ahead of time or even purchase pre-packaged chopped veggies. They\u2019ll have lost some nutrition, but it\u2019s a lot healthier for you than not having veggies at all. You know, when getting out the knife and cutting board seems like such a big deal?\nLeftovers, leftovers, leftovers\nIf you go through the effort to actually cook a meal and you aren\u2019t one of those who despise leftovers (like my mom), why not double, triple, or quadruple your recipe and eat it for the next few days? You can always make it more exciting by adding new veggies or sauces to each meal.\nFor on-the-go food, wrap up your leftovers in a romaine or collard leaf. Voila \u2013 it becomes an entirely different meal.\nFreeze leftovers in individual portions\nIf you get tired of the same thing a few days in a row, try freezing your leftovers to allow enough time to pass that they excite you again. It\u2019s like having TV dinners on stand-by except healthier and tastier!\nPurchase freezer-safe glass food storage containers at around 1.5 cups size or use glass jars you already have around the house. Then portion out single-servings of your extras into each glass container until they\u2019re all gone. Store in the freezer, and you\u2019ve got go-to meals.\nThaw out in advance on a busy day when you know you won\u2019t feel like cooking. If you didn\u2019t plan ahead, let thaw on the counter for a bit until the contents pops out of the container more easily. Then reheat the contents in a pot on the stove or in the oven. (Just remember not to put hot water on the freezer-cold glass.) To freshen up your resurrected dish, you can add new veggies when reheating or serve it along-side a salad.\nNow your turn.\nAre you allergic to the kitchen or just too busy to spend any time in there?

{"prompt": "Context:\nHow to start your wedding planning\nIt feels like there are a million things to do before planning the wedding, but if you focus on the big tasks the little details will begin to fall into place. There are 7 things you need to do before saying \u201cI do\u201d to keep your families, your partner, and yourself happy and well-prepared for the marriage road ahead. Plan to do them all to keep the rest of the wedding plans going smoothly.\n1. Call your families\nIt\u2019s perfectly acceptable, and even advisable, to notify your close family members by phone that you\u2019ve become engaged. Notify your parents and immediate family members right away, then notify other close family and friends you wish to tell. The mother of the bride will have lots of planning to do as the wedding approaches, so traditionally she is notified first.\n2. Set a Date\nThe day you get married has a huge amount of significance. Not only will the date appear on your invitations and wedding announcements, it may also be used in wedding day d\u00e9cor. Because the day you get married also represents your wedding anniversary, you may even have it engraved on your wedding rings.\nSetting the date is, in effect, setting a deadline for the wedding planning, so give yourself as much time as possible. Choose a date that has some special significance, base it around you and your partner\u2019s schedules, and plan for a day that\u2019s most comfortable for guests. Every little detail is important.\nPick several dates that may work, and narrow down the options as you learn more about venues and guest availability. Take time to set a date that will be just perfect, but don\u2019t put this off too long. It\u2019s very important to get your venues booked as early as possible so you will be able to secure the day you really want.\n3. Set a Budget\nDon\u2019t make any plans until you know how much you can spend. It\u2019s easy to get carried away thinking about dresses, venues, and food, but is that really all you\u2019re going to have? Remember that you may also want music, flowers, favors, a wedding cake, champagne, and table cloths. There\u2019s a long list of wedding items that go with the big day. Talk to your parents and talk to your partner to figure out exactly how much you have to spend in round figures. Once you know how much you can spend, you can start making a comprehensive budget to follow while you make all the rest of your wedding plans.\n4. Start the Guest List\nYour guest list determines the size of your wedding, an important consideration when you\u2019re picking venues and thinking about planning costs. Start with wedding party members and their partners, close family and friends and go from there. Will you include young children at the wedding? Should you invite your third grade teacher who inspired you? Writing the guest list often means making a lot of tough decisions. Think about who you want to be a part of your big day, and why, and go from there.\n5. Book the Venues\nWhere do you want to get married? Some couples choose their wedding venue for sentimental reasons, perhaps getting married in the same place as their parents or grandparents. The decision may be based on proximity. What\u2019s close to the two of you and your family members? Booking the venues for your wedding is a huge decision. Remember, where you\u2019re getting married will be featured in every single picture.\na. Wedding ceremony\nTraditional venues for wedding ceremonies include hotels, churches, beaches and outdoor gardens. Some couples may choose a more unique location, such as a museum or even a yacht. Choose a wedding ceremony venue based on affordability, guest seating, beauty and convenience.\nb. Reception\nYou may not always book your wedding and reception in the same place. When looking for a reception venue, you need something that\u2019s accessible to your various vendors, especially caterers. In addition to seating, you\u2019ll want information about serving liquor and food in the reception venue.\n6. Select an Officiant\nChoosing an officiant is an important aspect of the wedding planning. If one member of the couple has a family member who is a member of the clergy or a justice of the peace, this choice may be easy. Church-going couples may choose an officiant who is already part of their religious community. But other couples who have no strong religious ties have to go in search of an officiant who will be right for them. Consider religious concerns for both members of the future marriage when making this decision, as well as cost.\n7. RELAX!\nBefore walking down the aisle and saying \u201cI do,\u201d take a break! It\u2019s so easy to get stressed out during wedding planning, and both of you may need to relax for a few days before taking the big plunge. Spending time apart is perfectly healthy at this time. Spend at least a few hours away from wedding planning. Don\u2019t even think about the wedding! For brides, it\u2019s a good idea to schedule a spa day or a movie night with the girls. The groom may want to enjoy a round of golf or go fishing with his close friends.\nSettling on engagement rings is the easy part, because there\u2019s a host of things to consider. If you plan the important things well, though, and take time in between to give yourself a little TLC, the wedding itself can go off without a hitch!\n>.\n\nUser question:\nWhat are the seven steps to start wedding planning according to the context?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nMothers everywhere will receive gifts, cards and hugs this Sunday. But, for those who have suffered the loss of a child, the day is a time of remembered gifts and kisses.\nCheryl Wright of Pleasant Hills will spend her first Mother's Day without her daughter, Tia, 12, who was killed in a traffic accident on April 5.\nTia's father, Karl Wright, continues to recover from serious injuries suffered in that two-vehicle collision, blamed on a drunken teenage driver. Another 12-year-old, a passenger in the Wright car and Tia's best friend, is also recuperating from injuries.\nDespite her grief, Mrs. Wright is finding comfort from friends, neighbors -- even strangers.\n\"The community has been wonderful, [it] has done more than we could have ever expected,\" Mrs. Wright said.\nLocal businesses donated the funeral services and flowers for Tia, she said. Food was also donated to feed the more than 800 people who attended a memorial service at the Pleasant Hills Community Presbyterian Church on April 13.\nSince the funeral, friends and strangers continue to offer gestures of kindness. Neighbors have brought over dinners, and a landscaper volunteered to help plant flowers in the family's yard, Mrs. Wright said. Also, about 30 of Tia's friends showed up at the family's front door, she aid, looking for ways to help around the house. A neighborhood boy went door-to-door collecting money for the family.\nThe latest effort to support the Wright family is being spearheaded by the Thomas Jefferson Youth Cheerleading Association, which is selling rubber wristbands in Thomas Jefferson's school colors, black and gold. The bands read simply, \"Tia.\" Tia had cheered for years with the group.\nBracelet sales were officially kicked off Friday night at the high school at a basketball game between some Steelers and TJ youth football coaches. Proceeds benefitted the building of the TJ youth football complex, but about 100 bracelets were sold that night.\nThe group said that it is hoping to raise $10,000 by selling 2,000 bracelets, at a cost of $5 each. Because the wristbands were underwritten by local photography business Prints Charming Designs, Inc., all of the money spent to purchase bracelets will go to the Wright family.\n\"This felt like a great way to help out,\" said Bob Marlow, of Jefferson Hills, owner of Prints.\n\"I remember taking Tia's picture with the cheerleading squad, and her loss has really impacted me and my wife.\"\nHis business will spend about $500 to purchase the bracelets.\n\"There's not a family in this community that hasn't been impacted by what happened,\" Mr. Marlow said.\nTroy Baxendell, a youth football coordinator whose daughter cheered with Tia, said that he hopes the bracelets will not only help the Wright family, but will also send a message to the community, especially high school students, about the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\"This is a big wake-up call,\" he said. \"Hopefully the bracelets will serve as a tremendous reminder of how dangerous this kind of behavior can be.\"\nCrystal Lyons, the president of the Board of Directors of the Cheerleading Association and a mother of a TJ youth cheerleader, said that organizing the bracelet sales has helped the cheerleaders cope with their sense of loss.\n\"It's amazing to see how they have put aside grieving to see how they can help,\" she said.\nMrs. Wright said that she was especially touched by the cheerleader's efforts.\n\"Tia really enjoyed cheerleading,\" she said. \"She always had a big smile on her face and liked performing.\"\nThe continuing help is appreciated, Mrs. Wright said, since family life is demanding since the accident. Mrs. Wright continues to go to school full time to learn sonography. She attends CCAC at the Boyce campus in Monroeville. Tia's father who works for Fist Energy Corp in Shippingport, is still being treated for his injuries and recently underwent surgery on his leg to repair muscle damage. He will likely also require a steel rod to be inserted in his leg because of a shattered bone. Mrs. Wright said he will be in the hospital for at least eight more weeks.\n\"It's difficult, but feeling the support of everyone makes dealing with the hard times easier,\" she said.\n\"The strength of others does hold us up. This isn't easy, but the help we received has made it bearable,\" Mrs. Wright said. \"People are going out of their way to tell the family that they loved Tia, and her family.''\nMichele and Doug Childers, of Pleasant Hills, the parents of Taylor Childers, 12, who was in the Wright pickup with Tia during the accident, said that community has also offered prayers and support to their family. Taylor suffered a concussion, broken wrist, headaches and verbal memory loss. She will stay at home recovering for the remainder of the school year.\nTia and Taylor were best friends since the third grade, Mrs. Childers said, and were inseparable.\nMrs. Wright said she will spend Sunday with her two children Karl \"Woody\", 18, and Krista, 16. Together they will pay quiet tribute to Tia who Mrs. Wright describes as a child with an \"energetic sense of humor.''\n\"Every night at the dinner table she would work to make the family laugh, making silly faces.'' recalled her mom. \"Tia was the kind of child that a parent has a hard time ever yelling at.''\nThis school year was Tia's first year in middle school, her mother said, and she and her father were concerned that the transition would be difficult. \"But that wasn't the case. She kept her old friends and also made new ones. She was happy.\"\n\"I always saw a bright future for her,\" Mrs. Wright said. \"She was a little star.\"\nTia was a passenger in a pickup truck driven by her father, which collided with a sport utility vehicle on Gill Hall Road in Jefferson Hills. She died of blunt force trauma at the scene. The teenage driver of the car that collided with her father's vehicle has been charged in connection with Tia's death. Police said the 17-year-old boy, who was not injured, had been drinking alcohol, speeding and driving recklessly. He is charged with homicide by vehicle while D.U.I, homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault while driving drunk and a number of summary violations. He is in Shuman Juvenile Detention Center. Police said he will be prosecuted as a juvenile.\nTia bracelets can be ordered online at or purchased at Meder's Nursery, 360 Regis Ave, Pleasant Hills.\n\nUser question:\nWhat initiative is the Thomas Jefferson Youth Cheerleading Association undertaking to support the Wright family?\n"}

{"prompt": "Context:\nAnalysis: cut in dividend may sound a warning to APMM investors\nIt is my view that we have heard lots of promises and little else, although these promises need time \u2013 years, possibly \u2013 before they bear fruit.\nHowever, time is one thing that Maersk has at its disposal, based on its recent financial performance and cash balances, despite the challenging end markets for most of its business lines.\nWaiting game\nSo here\u2019s a soft warning to all those corporate executives, suppliers and investors who are bullish about organic growth backed by rising rates in the container shipping industry. Many I have talked to are genuinely bullish in their belief that equity and operational risk are manageable within Maersk Line, the main value-driver of the group.\nto be a record year for M&A in container shipping.\nIt is important to consider that, if you have followed Maersk\u2019s recent corporate action, you would realise that if its equity value doesn\u2019t hold up at around its current level \u2013 or even falls, it will hinder its negotiating power, let alone its ability to use stock as M&A currency in future deal-making.\nAcquisitions, of course, will continue to be a key component in its corporate strategy following the purchase of its German rival, which recently received the green light from the European Commission \u2013 and that means that any mis-steps in corporate strategy could cost it dearly.\nTiptoeing\nFirst-quarter results released this month clearly pointed to improved cash flows on a year-on-year comparable basis, but rising cash flows have not risen enough to cover core investment needs, while cash balances were down significantly, and net debt \u2013 up by $1bn since the end of the fourth quarter of last year \u2013 continued to soar.\nIn the first quarter, it churned out more cash from operations than a year ago, while reducing heavy investment by about $600m to $1.2bn, which partly benefited its daily cash-burn rate. Nonetheless, it burned about $4m for every day during the period, based on $376m of negative free cash flow in the first quarter.\nIn its results presentation, APMM emphasises that 2017 and 2018 are years of transition, but its shares continue to defy the law of gravity \u2013 indeed, its current share price seems to suggest there\u2019s no short-term risk here.\nBut success breeds complacency, and this breeds failure. And in the precarious world of finance, one bad quarter is all that\u2019s needed to change the risk perception towards Maersk and its plan, harming its ability to count on a strong equity valuation, so important when it comes to managing expectations of customers and investors, as was so recently in evidence during the Yang Ming saga.\nIn Copenhagen, management talked of a \u201cgradual improvement for Maersk Line\u201d, which has problems in steeply rising bunker costs; APM Terminals was described as facing \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d; after a genuine turnaround, Damco\u2019s \u201cforwarding margins are under pressure\u201d; APPM\u2019s drilling operations continue to focus on \u201ccosts savings and operational performance\u201d; and, finally, smaller units such as Supply Services, Tankers and Svitzer fared worse than a year earlier.\nOne bright spot was Maersk Oil, although most of the surge in its reported profit, to $328m (versus a first-quarter 2016 loss of $29m), came as a result of a massive reduction in operating costs, down to $389m in the first quarter from $560m one year earlier, and a one-off benefit in tax income of $24m.\nAn outlier was Maersk Container Industry (MCI), which enjoyed different dynamics based on its new production capabilities following the full launch of its new factory in Chile, catering for increased demand from third parties for its StarCool reefers and the associated software developed to support the technology. However, the picture MCI offered was generally unchanged from 2016, based on return on invested capital, which is a key gauge of efficient capital deployment.\nAPMM\u2019s quarterly results do not warrant a granular look at the financials of each division in isolation, because it is more important to understand how its vast assets base is currently working in unison, given that good and bad assets might have to sit under the same umbrella for quite a long time before a formal separation of transport and energy occurs.\nIt is possible that Maersk\u2019s management is preoccupied by the possibility of impairments and one-off charges deriving from a formal break-up of the group, which could imbalance its net worth, or equity capital, eventually requiring a cash call to shore up its capital structure. After all, it\u2019s relatively easy to hide losses under its current conglomerate structure, and that could be a reason why it didn\u2019t reach agreement with DONG Energy to merge certain oil and gas assets in the past \u2013 although DONG itself appears to be undergoing a strategic transformation.\nIt is far too early to say if one-off items will prevent a full break-up, but another issue here is the paucity of eager buyers. This is a dreadful market for sellers looking to offload capital-intensive assets to trade buyers, while the public market route is also tricky as investors are wary of the risks associated to committing to any story where cyclicality could sink their returns.\nWhich, all in all, leads me to think that \u201cNew\u201d Maersk could very well end up looking just like \u201cOld\u201d Maersk.\nWarnings\nCash balances are falling fast, yet its overall \u201cliquidity reserves\u201d, as Maersk labels cash in hand and certain credit facilities, are reassuring, although uncertainty reigns about its future plans. And one event in particular testifies to a difficult situation where Maersk does not want to commit to sticking to any particular promise \u2013 a dividend cut that emerged in early February.\nA year earlier, Maersk paid out an ordinary dividend of Dkr300.\nBack in February 2016, I warned income seekers that dividend risk was apparent through to 2017, and this is now my second warning for investors who want capital appreciation: its stock market value is out of whack with reality, especially considering that capex projections imply heavier investment for the reminder of the year, based on guidance of between $5.5bn and $6.5bn.\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the main value-driver of the Maersk group?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nHands-On:\nFuse\nPosted on October 18, 2012 AT 12:33pm\nLighting the Fuse\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that the holidays are already upon us and that the calendar year is coming to an end. Usually, this is a great time for people to reflect on the events of the past year that have transpired. This is also a good time, however, to look ahead. And in that vein, EA held their \u2018Naughty or Nice\u2019 event in New York and allowed us to play some games slated for the next few months depending on if we\u2019ve been good boys or girls (hence the name of the event). Some lucky few of us have been particularly naughty this year though and were able to go hands-on with Fuse, the upcoming third-person shooter from Insomniac Games.\nIn Fuse, you play as one of four misfit soldiers in the near future as part of a group called Overstrike 9 who work for the government after they start developing experimental weapons with an alien substance dubbed Fuse (hence the name of the game). Your objective is to then take down a corrupt organization known as \u2018Raven\u2019 with your new alien-powered weapons while also working as a cohesive unit.\nWhat looks to separate Fuse from every other third-person shooter out there is not only the Fuse powered weaponry you acquire, but the ability to hop between all four members of the team should you be playing solo. This is critical as each member of the team has a distinct style and special abilities that will allow you to overcome the obstacles in your path. Of course, the game will also feature and encourage co-op, but gives you this option incase you\u2019re like me and prefer to play games by yourself in a dank hole in the ground and the game can still therefore convey that feeling of being in an organized group.\nThe first character I tried was the fiery redhead Izzy. Her Fuse weapon\u2019s special ability is to fire matter at enemies that freezes them in place, allowing you to focus on other targets or shatter them into tiny pieces with a melee maneuver and conserve your ammo.\nNext, was Dalton and his ability was a special energy shield that not only prevents you and your teammates from being hit, but increases your ammo\u2019s strength should you fire back through the shield yourselves.\nThen came Jacob and he was one of my favorites. He has a special crossbow that not only allows you to impale enemies into the wall (think the Javelin Gun from Dead Space 2), but if multiple bolts are in the environment, you can link them together via an electric tether and then incinerate anything caught in-between the field. A perfect example of this was at one point in our demo a group of riot shield wielding thugs tried to storm the facility we just captured. In order to get them to drop their guard, I fired a bolt in front of the group, and two behind. I then activated the link and created a giant triangle of fire that killed many of the guards and the few who survived were so panicked that they were easy pickings for the rest of the squad.\nFinally came Naya and she was another favorite of mine. Not only does she have an awesome gun that opens up miniature black holes from within enemies and consumes anyone close to it, which in and of itself is amazingly badass, but she also has a cloak that allows you to flank or sneak up on unsuspecting enemies and create havoc from behind enemy lines. I used this to get by many a turret in the demo and it saved me often as it\u2019s easy to lose the invisible person in the midst of a firefight.\nAside from the brilliant gunplay, the game also features a cover system that worked well enough when compared to what is out on the market currently, and a simple free-running mechanic as the various characters could do things any normal soldier would do like hop over chain link fences to get to alternate pathways or to a breachable wall or door.\nAfter infiltrating and wreaking havoc on the Raven facility, the group was met by a bi-pedal mechanized monstrosity reminiscent of something out of early Metal Gear. After taking trash to the group, the robot began pummeling us with lasers, missiles, and melee attacks as it hopped around the enclosed area we were fighting in. But with four people to attack it at once, it had difficulty targeting multiple foes and by literally running circles around it, we were able to turn the robot into scrap.\nAlthough our time with Fuse was short, the game felt immensely satisfying as I played both by myself and with other people. The Insomniac staple of insane weaponry is evident clearly right from the get go and the unique abilities these weapons afford you looks like they\u2019ll hopefully keep the game play fresh throughout. The only question now is if the story can live up to the off-the-wall fun the weapons provided and give us a wholly entertaining experience when the game is released in March 2013.\nToday's Top 10 Stories\nPartner Pages\nTop Partner Stories\nThird Floor,\nBeverly Hills, CA 90211\nWebsite Interface \u00a9 2012 EGM Digital Media, LLC.\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the unique feature of the game Fuse that separates it from other third-person shooter games?\n"}

No matter how hard I try I can't see him saying snowman. lol so weird.\nI'll just take a stab and say that maybe, because of his accent and the different ways he pronounces things, his mouth would move differently and be harder to read, and that is why you keep reading something different than what we are hearing?\nI have been rewinding and watching that part of the show over and over again...\nI can't almost hear \"snowman\" the first time he says it, but I hear \"silhoette\" loud and clear the second time...

{"prompt": "Context:\nBuilding a strong, well-balanced startup team is no small feat, and retaining good talent is even more challenging. That\u2019s because nowadays there are very few \u201clifers\u201d (people that stay 10-30+ years in one place) and more people who hop from job to job. An 2010 Intuit study predicts that by 2020, 40% of America\u2019s workforce will be contract, temporary, or self-employed workers. On top of that trend, co-founder relationships remain tenuous. Currently, co-founder conflict is the number-one startup killer; 65% of startups fail due to co-founder strife, according to Noam Wasserman, a Harvard Business School professor.\nHow do you overcome these hurdles and excel at assembling a talented team for your business? Here are some key things to consider:\n1. Find the right co-founders.\nShould you go it alone or get co-founder(s)? Choosing to go solo or partnering with co-founders both have pros and cons. While neither is easy in the beginning, each have different results in the long run. In a TechCrunch article that analyzed top unicorn startups, the author found that only 10% of successful startups were led by solo founders. And according to First Round, teams with more than one founder outperformed teams with solo founders by a factor of 163%. While you can still be successful on your own, the odds of success increase when you have a co-founder. There are plenty of resources to help find your ideal co-founder, such as CoFoundersLab and in-person meetup events.\n2. Recruit influential advisors.\nSeek to recruit advisors who balance your weaker areas to ensure that that you have comprehensive support. Most people\u2019s first instinct is to find individuals who are like themselves, but you must resist the temptation. Pick advisors who you respect and who have deep expertise in key areas.\nRemember: Disagreements are healthy and essential to innovation. A homogenous organization is more likely to experience stunted growth because too many ideas go unchallenged. Advisors should have the necessary expertise to provide guidance during challenging times. While they do not have all the answers, advisors are effective because they reduce friction and ask the right questions. To get the most out of your advisors, you must allow them to help you and encourage them to openly submit their feedback. Also, you must always remember that your advisors are people before they\u2019re advisors; form a relationship with them that goes beyond their role at your company and any similarities you might share.\nRelated: Learn how to bring on great advisors\n3. Partner with strategic board members.\nBoard members are individuals appointed to ensure that companies are meeting their fiduciary duties and to manage corporate governance. Typically, they\u2019re personally liable for any company misconduct. To this end, the board helps hold the executive team accountable for delivery and execution and ensures that the company is in good health and following through on its strategy.\nThe CEO meets with the board periodically (monthly or quarterly) to review progress, receive approval, or discuss pending decisions. Founders should begin building their board as soon as possible. It\u2019s common for board structures to start small and grow over time in parallel with the company\u2019s growth. Boards are typically comprised of major investors, founders, and, for larger companies, independents who can bring their expertise to the organization.\nA typical startup board may have only three members, but that number may grow to five or more after the first round of real funding. Be judicious in who you invite to be a member of the board. And don't forget that you can add certain strategic partners as board observers. These board members can assist the company and participate in meetings without assuming the legal liability and control issues associated with a full board seat.\n4. Make sure your first hires are rockstars.\nTime is always of the essence in the startup world and you can increase your odds of success by hiring top talent from the start. The benefit of hiring leaders (as opposed to followers) is that they are not afraid to think differently and push you into uncharted territories. By surrounding yourself with smart and experienced people, it elevates the entire company and sets the tone for your company to act as a change agent in its field.\nRelated: How to master first hires\n5. Set up your company practices to be data-driven\nNo matter the company, every leader wants to know how well they are performing and how to make the right strategic decisions. A/B testing is a great way to guide strategic decisions. Avoid leading the company based on your personal preferences as a customer, and be sure to leverage various tests to let the market dictate what resonates best.\nBy leveraging data to make strategic decisions, you\u2019re able to remove the bias that you likely bring to the decision-making process. Additionally, you\u2019ll be creating a culture where team members feel empowered to make bigger decisions and take on more responsibilities because data is giving them new, unique insights in the company. A data-driven approach makes for a truly scalable and holistic way of leading.\nTo build a strong team, you\u2019ll need a multi-tiered approach that includes: 1. The right team structure at the outset 2. The right people for each role and 3. An empowered team that grows by using data to make insightful decisions.\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the number one reason for startup failure according to Noam Wasserman, a Harvard Business School professor?\n"}

{"prompt": "Context:\n10 Important Things my Yoga Practice Taught Me.\nReflections from the yoga mat.\nI was inspired by Kate Bartolotta\u2019s recent post, So What Do Gomukhasana and Joseph Campbell Have in Common? This post got me thinking about what it is that I get from stepping onto my yoga mat almost every day.\nHere\u2019s what I came up with:\n1. Unapologetic \u201cme\u201d time. My yoga practice requires me to step inside of my own skin and focus on myself. At so many other points throughout my day, I\u2019m needed by my toddler. There are definitely times when I\u2019ve wondered if my daily practice is selfish, but I come to the same conclusion over and over again. I am a better mother to her because I have this space for myself.\n2. Health. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I came to my yoga practice for my body. Yet I don\u2019t think I ever expected my physical self to ultimately be the last thing I hop onto my mat for. Still, there\u2019s no denying that I love the body that my yoga practice has made\u2014and I love the health and invigoration I feel both during my mat and during the rest of my daily life.\n3. Self-growth. I have absolutely grown as a person because of my yoga practice. It\u2019s forced me to confront my ego, my needs for control and perfection, and my deeply ingrained type-A personality\u2014and I can\u2019t believe how much of these self-defining qualities no longer define me because of my practice.\n4. Patience. I\u2019m certainly not a patient person, but I\u2019m more patient than I used to be. I think part of this comes from simply working on poses that literally took me years to get into the full posture (or I\u2019m still working on). My practice has also taught me to enjoy those poses between poses\u2014better known as life.\n5. Take time to be still. Some of my best practices involve me sitting in the same place on my mat; focusing on my breath or getting deeply into one posture and then holding it. I\u2019ve taken this stillness out into my daily life, and for a hyperactive ADD person, this is a huge accomplishment, no medication required.\n6. I\u2019m not the same person every day, and that\u2019s okay. I can be a really moody lady, and my mat has let me come to terms with this. During my yoga practice, I feel out how my body and my moods are shifting all the time\u2014and I\u2019ve learned that my life is often most successful when I acknowledge and accept my current situations rather than always swimming upstream.\n7. Happiness is my responsibility. Sure, other people can affect our moods\u2014but they don\u2019t get credit for causing them. Your happiness is your responsibility, period. My yoga practice gets the credit for this realization because I learned how much power and control I have over myself from my mat time. Example: if I\u2019m distracted during a balance pose, it\u2019s not the fault of the girl in front of me in class, it\u2019s mine. Another example: during my home practice, I can really take the time to reflect on how I feel in the present moment physically, emotionally, and mentally; and I\u2019ve experienced the power in letting these feelings fall away as I just focus on flowing from pose to pose. Many times, all that ends up being left afterwards is ease and a deep sensation of tranquility.\n8. My body is beautiful. No, I didn\u2019t reach this conclusion because of the physical body that my practice sculpts. Rather, I\u2019ve been able to find an appreciation for myself on a much deeper level and this has forced me to accept that quite often, the level of satisfaction we have with our outer bodies is directly connected to the level of satisfaction we have with ourselves internally.\n9. Yoga exists off the mat. Ironically, having a regular practice of asanas has taught me to see the yoga that I practice constantly, when I\u2019m no where near my mat.\n10. Be open. A lot of Kate\u2019s blog revolved around the need to open ourselves up. For me, this is probably the most impacting thing I\u2019ve learned from my mat time. Through poses I thought I\u2019d never access and then did, I\u2019ve learned to be open to final outcomes that you never expected or even dreamed of. I\u2019ve also learned that opening your heart to other people, and to your own self, is scary and vulnerable\u2014but it\u2019s necessary to live your existence to its fullest. Open your heart, even when it hurts; because otherwise you will not experience the full range of joy that life has to offer either.\nLet me say that these are the most life-impacting things I\u2019ve learned from my regular yoga practice. Are these going to be the same important things you gain from your mat time? Probably not, because you and I are not the same; and I think I could make that number 11\u2014to get the most from your yoga practice you have to tune in and experience it yourself.\nFortunately and unfortunately, the best aspects of life cannot be taught\u2014they have to be lived and experienced by you alone.\nI do hope, however, that this list of lessons from my own personal experience has inspired you to figure out exactly what it is that you get from your own practice. Why, exactly, do you step on your mat?\nOnce you answer that, find more questions..}\n[\u2026] 10 Important Things my Yoga Practice Taught Me. [\u2026]\n[\u2026] I deepened my yoga practice by getting my Crossfit [\u2026]\n[\u2026] [\u2026]\nAnytime me and my wife doing yoga, we feel much more relaxed and calm for a long time. I notice for me morning time is the best time to do yoga. I guess it's different for everyone.\nYoga has way more to it than getting a healthier body. While many people like myself will come to a Yoga class for getting a better body, I am pretty sure each of them do experience the spiritual aspects of it at some time if they stick to it. Over years of my Yoga practice, I have experiences huge range of benefits from Yoga. Thanks for summing up your Yoga experience in these ten beautiful points and sharing them here.\n\nUser question:\nWhat are some of the benefits the author has experienced from their regular yoga practice?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nDis.\n2. The BFG (July 1)\nSpielberg + Disney + a big, friendly giant = Yes, please!\n3. Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates (July 8)\nOver the past six months, no trailer has received bigger laughs in theaters than Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates. Admittedly, I have a Zac Efron bias but Dirty Grandpa ranks as one of the worst movies of 2016 which is proof I can overcome the bias. That being said, this is one I\u2019m really looking forward to.\n4. Star Trek Beyond (July 29)\nI might be the only person in the world that didn\u2019t have a problem with the first trailer for Star Trek Beyond. Conversely, while the newer trailers have been better received, my interest has waned in the latest installment in the Star Trek series.\n5. Jason Bourne (July 29)\nThis is likely to be the biggest threat to The Secret Life of Pets. Matt Damon\u2019s return to the Bourne series should give the franchise a boost and from a quality standpoint, adding Alicia Vikander in a supporting role doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n6. Ghostbusters (July 15)\nWho would have thought Ghostbusters would be the most controversial movie of the summer? Are we really that unnerved by female leads that recasting the protagonists of the classic would turn the world upside down? Seriously, we should be more upset the theme song is being done by Fall Out Boy. Oh, wait! We are?\n7. The Infiltrator (July 13)\nBryan Cranston still has that Breaking Bad halo around him and it\u2019s always great to see John Leguizamo in any role. Cranston as an undercover U.S. customs agent who infiltrates some of the largest drug cartels and finds a path to Pablo Escobar sounds like a winner.\n8. Bad Moms (July 29)\nAs much as this looks like a bad idea on paper, the cast and the trailer have me strangely intrigued. I\u2019ll watch almost anything Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are in so putting them together makes it a must see. I\u2019ll probably regret it.\n9. Tulip Fever (July 15)\nAlicia Vikander will have a hard time topping her 2015. While her biggest role of the year is yet to come (The Light Between Oceans), Vikander playing a woman having an affair with an artist (Dane DeHaan) while trying to escape from her husband (Christoph Waltz) should be enough to hold any fan over.\n10. Nerve (July 27)\nNerve could be fun or it could be grating on your nerves. The Emma Roberts/Dave Franco thriller might catch lightning in a bottle like The Shallows but could also tank considering the directing duo of Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost are responsible for Paranormal Activity 3 and 4.\n11. Lights Out (July 22)\nEasily, the most frightening horror trailer of the summer. It\u2019s unlikely the film will come together into anything cohesive but it looks like one that hits all the standard horror buttons.\n12. The Legend of Tarzan (July 1)\nNo matter how well The Legend of Tarzan is received, it\u2019s hard to imagine it living up to that $180 million budget. The cast led by Alexander Skarsgard\u2019s six pack abs also features Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Christoph Waltz and Djimon Hounsou. It also proves director David Yates can do soething other than Harry Potter movies.\n13. Captain Fantastic (July 8)\nViggo Mortensen is a father raising six kids off the grid. The story follows the family as Mortensen\u2019s Ben is forced to leave his paradise in the forests of the Pacific Northwest for civilization. Director Matt Ross won best director at Cannes for the film. This one has a lot of promise.\n14. Don\u2019t Think Twice (July 22)\nLove the cast (especially Keegan-Michael Key and Gillian Jacobs) and the premise as improv comedy is one of the more interesting forms of comedy there is.\n15. Equity (July 29)\nIt\u2019s basically being sold as the female version of The Wolf of Wall Street. At least it\u2019s something different.\n16. Our Kind of Traitor (July 1)\nEwan McGregor seems to make 2-3 movies a year that come out of nowhere and then disappear into the ether. This is likely to be one of those movies.\n17. The Purge: Election Year (July 1)\nWasn\u2019t excited about any of the previous versions of this franchise, why should I be now?\n18. Cell (July 8)\nTypically, Stephen King adaptations don\u2019t get buried especially ones featuring John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. Expect the worst.\n19. Fathers and Daughters (July 8)\nI\u2019m not sure about the premise but the cast is promising. Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Aaron Paul, Jane Fonda and Bruce Greenwood are the primary players. It\u2019s hard to get excited about a film that might not make it to wide release though.\n20. Caf\u00e9 Society (July 15)\nWoody Allen continues to churn out movies. Apparently, in this one, he asked Jesse Eisenberg to do his best Woody Allen impression. Let\u2019s hope Eisenberg isn\u2019t method.\n21. Undrafted (July 15)\nThis one tests my love for all things baseball. Like Rob Dibble used to do when he provided color commentary for the Nationals.\n22. The Dog Lover (July 8)\nCompletely under the radar until seeing the trailer and, well, it\u2019s still under the radar.\n23. Ice Age: Collision Course (July 22)\nMake the bad sequels stop, please!\n24.

{"prompt": "Context:\nRepresentatives from emids joined a diverse group of visionaries who convened in Nashville August 22\u201325 to discuss how to build a more affordable, sustainable future of health at the third annual Health:Further Festival. Hosted by Nashville\u2019s healthcare innovation fund Jumpstart Foundry, the gathering drew a mash-up of payers, providers, employers, marketers, investors and entrepreneurs, as well as attendees across industries and ideologies who shared their ideas for advancing the delivery of next-generation healthcare.\nWe enjoyed conversing with these innovators and connecting with startups pioneering technologies that promise to truly transform health and wellness in the years ahead. A few that caught our eye included WaveFire, a cloud-based HIPAA compliance management platform that simplifies the process of completing a security risk analysis in complex organizations; Belle, an online platform that provides on-demand health and beauty services; and Perception Health, a healthcare analytics firm that identifies and solves patient leakage issues for provider networks.\nThis year, the festival-style conference expanded to a four-day event featuring more than 140 speakers, networking sessions, live musical performances, a pitch competition, and the ninth annual meeting of TN HIMSS Summit of the Southeast, which emids sponsored. Gov. Bill Haslam capped off the festivities with exciting news that Netherlands-based consumer technology giant Philips will be opening a healthcare technology center in the Nashville area and creating more than 800 jobs. We look forward to welcoming Philips to Nashville!\nImpact of Consumerism, Emerging Technologies\nA Consumer Summit, titled \u201cDisruption on Demand: Humanizing the Healthcare Paradigm,\u201d kicked off the first day of Health:Further sessions at the Country Music Hall of Fame, with a star-studded lineup that included TV personality and health advocate Dr. Mehmet Oz, NBA Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins and CrossFit founder Greg Glassman. Speakers from the entertainment, hospitality and sports world shared stories of consumer-driven disruption and how those examples could apply to healthcare. Dr. Oz joined WebMD founder Jeff Arnold, both founders of the health and wellness platform Sharecare, which has offices in Franklin, TN, in discussing how attendees could use technology to build true engagement with healthcare consumers. \u201cPeople do not change based on what they know; they change based on how they feel,\u201d Dr. Oz told the audience. HTC Vive virtual reality product strategist Vinay Narayan followed up with a talk on how providers could use virtual reality headsets, not only to train doctors but also to better educate and motivate patients.\nThe rest of the conference, which was held at Music City Center and featured programming from TN HIMSS, explored disruptive technologies with the potential revolutionize healthcare, as well as barriers to change. We especially enjoyed the morning panel on artificial intelligence (AI) and data science, which highlighted the opportunities and challenges of using artificial intelligence in healthcare and precision medicine. Panelists agreed that while AI won\u2019t replace physicians, it will allow them to be more efficient and make better decisions at the bedside. \u201cMore information is better,\u201d said Damian Mingle, Chief Data Scientists for Intermedix, which equips organizations with technology and analytical tools to handle crisis management, revenue optimization and other health and safety concerns. \u201cGetting that good information in the right hands of someone who knows how to synthesize that works really well.\u201d\nDriving Innovation from the Ground Up\nOther standout speakers included Jessica Sweeney-Platt, Executive Director of Physician Performance Research for AthenaHealth, who shared data insights from high-performing physician networks; John Bass, Founder and CEO of Hashed Health, who explained the disruptive benefits of blockchain technology for healthcare; and a panel on consumerism and data analytics that featured the groundbreaking work of Nashville\u2019s Center for Medical Interoperability. Another highlight was the conversation between leaders at Brookdale Senior Living and Lyft about the impact of the on-demand ride-sharing partnership they created for seniors. Lack of reliable transportation causes millions of seniors to miss or delay medical appointments, but Brookdale and Lyft are teaming up to alleviate this issue through an app that enables senior living communities to request rides on behalf of residents.\nAlso topping the conference agenda was a report on the state of healthcare reform from U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn. While she noted that recent legislation should pave the way for advancing telemedicine and other nontraditional models of care, Rep. Blackburn urged attendees to take the lead in modernizing how healthcare is delivered. \u201cYou guys are going to solve how healthcare is delivered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not going to be solved in Washington.\u201d\nAlong with the informative sessions and many networking opportunities, the highlight of Health:Further for us was getting the chance to mingle with up-and-coming healthcare entrepreneurs, hear their pitches, and look for ways we could offer guidance and resources to help.\n\u201cWe definitely want to be a partner to early-stage ventures in the healthcare community and encourage them to come up with new ideas and technologies, because that helps our ecosystem overall,\u201d said Rebekah Panepinto, Senior Director of Business Development for emids.\n\nUser question:\nWhat was the purpose of the third annual Health:Further Festival held in Nashville?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\n.\nSince.\nCritics of the Drug War have been saying for years that the solution is to face the harsh fact that the \u201cwar\u201d begun in the Reagan years is a tragic and burdensome failure that only continues to exist on its own insidious momentum. The fundamental concept is wrong, and despite his own faults, Mexican President Calderon is right that the roots of the problem are here in the United States, not in Mexico, Central America and South America.\nIt needs to be understood that the illegal drug business operates like any business and follows the same basic laws of supply and demand. It is free-private enterprise at its most basic: The more risk, the more profit there is to be gained. For many inner city kids, it\u2019s virtually a Horatio Alger story of working hard and making it. I see that in the prison writing I encounter regularly in the creative writing class I\u2019ve taught for ten years in a Philadelphia prison.\nInstead of trying to crush this powerful business cycle at the supply side through police and military violence, with courts and prisons, it makes much more sense to be pragmatic, recognize the power of the business cycle, then use social and medical institutions to address those individuals who fail to comport themselves to a agreed-upon social contract.\nIs this radical? Of course, it\u2019s radical. The Tea Party is radical. It\u2019s radical in the constructive sense of tracing a problem to the root decisions that pointed it toward what is now a dysfunctional condition. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cWake up and smell the coffee!\u201d\nInstead of worrying where drugs are grown and manufactured and by whom and how much profits they are making, we could instead do like the Dutch and realize there is going to always be temptation in life and, then, seriously ask why so many people in this country are compelled to use drugs. Then address that.\nIt\u2019s not as if there\u2019s no precedent in American history: The end of Prohibition in the 1930s followed this exact arc. Instead of continuing to futilely focus on stopping supply and, in the process, encouraging a gangster underworld, state corruption and social hypocrisy \u2014 instead, recognize we can\u2019t stop human nature. It can\u2019t be done.\nTo borrow from E. F. Schumacher, author of that famous 1973 book, Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If People Mattered, the solution is to address our very real drug problem \u2013 \u201cas if people mattered.\u201d In the sociological and criminological worlds the concept is known as Harm Reduction. Instead of exacerbating a problem, figure out how to reduce it.\nReasonable arguments like this are not new, but they perennially face an incredible barrier that can be summed up best this way: The most insurmountable addiction problem encountered in the Drug War is not the addiction to drugs; it is the societal addiction to police, the military, courts and prisons. One of the foremost problems keeping these institutions jammed up is their determined focus on illegal drug sales, victimless drug use and the very real crimes associated with obtaining funds to purchase drugs, which of course are so expensive due to the business risks associated with the Drug War. It\u2019s all circular.\nI attended a seminar recently called Trauma 101 taught by a psychiatrist named Sandra Bloom. She asked if anyone had heard of something called the ACE Study or knew what an ACE Score was. Of 35 in the room, two raised their hands. Then she asked who had heard of swine flu, and everybody raised their hand. She laughed knowingly.\nACE stands for Adverse Childhood Experiences, a collaboration between the Center for Disease Control and the health provider Kaiser Permanente. It focuses on \u201canalyzing the relationship between multiple categories of childhood trauma and health and behavioral outcomes later in life.\u201d\nThe score is based on a list of 10 questions, five of which ask about experiences of abuse one received before the age of 18 (physical, psychological, sexual, emotional and neglect) and the rest ask about things going on in the household one was raised in as a child (substance abuse, mental illness, divorce, incarceration and abuse of mother).\nAs a person\u2019s ACE Score rises, Bloom said confidently, the probability of that person abusing drugs, alcohol and a host of other problems, including violence, abuse of others and incarceration, rises with it. It\u2019s shown to be fairly predictable.\nThe way we address problems like drug abuse now, she said, in fact exacerbates and compounds the problems focused on by the ACE Score. She cited a study that essentially concluded, \u201cif we could eliminate childhood trauma we could eliminate 78 percent of drug addiction problems.\u201d\nAlright. I can hear the chorus of nay-sayers now about \u201cthose damn liberals\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s socialism\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t coddle criminals\u201d and so forth. That\u2019s the voice of denial from people addicted to police and prisons.\nIn the Netherlands they have largely figured it out. When I was there a few years ago with a small group that included a former attorney general of Pennsylvania, a psychiatrist told us how the Dutch mother teaches her child to be aware of temptation in the world and to trust his or her \u201cinner locus of control.\u201d As an ancient port city, temptation has always existed in Amsterdam, he said. The Dutch learn to deal with it \u2014 or the state helps them based on an agreed upon social contract.\nAlthough we pride ourselves on our independence, in America we have come to rely on \u201cexterior loci of control,\u201d the police, military, courts and prisons. The trouble is when you pit this tough-guy exterior system against a softer, interior-based harm reduction system, you realize the former costs vastly more money for more and more prisons and other means of control; plus, as you ratchet up the tools of state violence you provoke a violent opposition. The result is what we have: a disastrous, never-ending cycle of violence.\nClearly, the Drug War is not working in Mexico. As The New York Times reports the cartels and their violence are now moving into the small republics of Central America. People are becoming terrified.\nAs President Calderon\u2019s PAN party is forced to address the failures of his war policy and the very real fears of the Mexican people, maybe there\u2019s a chance someone up here in Gringolandia will overhear his message that the real problem of the Drug War resides right under our noses in the demand for drugs.\nBecause, again, Calderon is right. And, furthermore, with time, patience and a focus on our demand problem we can go a long way to solving our drug problem.\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the ACE Score and what does it predict?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nThe superhero game is a funny specimen indeed. Mostly these games are crap attempts at raping a quick buck from the public with a tie-in related to some blockbuster holiday movie. Rarely are they done well with a few shining moments of awesome like Batman : Arkham Asylum, Spider-Man 2, X-Men Origins : Wolverine and (arguably) The Darkness, but even the crap ones tend to have ONE good thing about them. Usually, everything else in the game is terrible. So anytime I hear there\u2019s a new game with a dude in spandex running around town being all goody-two-shoes, I prepare myself for the worst.\nSpiderman : Shattered Dimensions is not tied to a movie or even a comic book series but has a whole new story made for this game. Essentially, the very fabric of space time continueum has been disrupted by a Spidey bad guy called Mysterio which sends ripples through the alternate realities of Spider-Man\u2019s world, affecting the \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d universe, the \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d universe, the \u201cNoir Spider-Man\u201d universe and the \u201c2099 Spider-Man\u201d universe and your friend, Madam Web, helps the 4 different Spidermen to put things right. Confused yet? To be honest, you tend to forget the story as they tell it because it\u2019s just boring and too complicated to remember really. But story isn\u2019t everything, right?\nSpidey : SD is a very linear beat-em-up which came as a huge surprise to me since every other Spidey game has had some sort of free roam, open world feel to it. When you are a character who is largely defined by his mode of transport (web slinging), fans tend to want that ability but at most, you\u2019ll be using it to get over a hole that can not be jumped across. The game layout is done through a series of lengthy boss battles played out as entire levels. After completing a set of 4, another will unlock. You can\u2019t even just pick a universe and go from start to finish which really upset me because the four different universes play so differently and have their own pros and cons.\nIn the \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d universe, gameplay is very similar to the God of War/Wolverine style beat \u2019em up with the camera being too slow for the lightning quick attacks of the hero. More often than not, you will find yourself just button mashing to get anywhere with some working results. Using your webs as extensions, you can pound the tar out of all the bad guys relatively easily. Graphically, they\u2019ve touched up everything with cell shading, which actually looks nice and gives rich colour to everything around but best of all, is Neil Patrick Harris as the voice of amazing spiderman. The dialogue is witty and, at times, laugh out loud so fans of the original character won\u2019t be completely let down.\nIn the \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d universe, the game seems to switch into a more acrobatic and speedy fighting game. Strangely though, the lazy ass camera issues of the Amazing universe don\u2019t seem to exist in this dimension. The controls feel a bit tighter and you do feel more powerful as enemies tend to die a bit quicker at your hands in this particular game mode. The voice acting is quite good here too with the same voice actors involved with the Ultimate Spider-Man game from the PS2/Gamecube days. The script for this section will make you laugh hard and generally you get the feeling that the makers do favour \u201cUltimate\u201d over \u201cAmazing\u201d.\nOkay, then there\u2019s the \u201cNoir universe\u201d. Based on the new series of comics started in 2008. Set in 1933, Noir Spidey is all about stealth. No new tech gadgetry. Stay in the shadows and take your enemy down silently. Which would be great if the AI wasn\u2019t as dumb as one shoe! You can take down a gangster in full view of everyone and no one seems to care. Accidentally step into a spotlight and suddenly everyone gets pissed off. Also, you are encouraged to use the walls and ceilings to your advantage but the controls just don\u2019t agree. To stick to a wall, you have to push the stick towards it in conjuction with the camera. Which changes because you are moving towards the wall. Needless to say, this universe made me say bad, bad words. Stealth Spidey just doesn\u2019t work and feels like a bad high school experiment.\nI have purposely saved the best for last. I have been a big 2099 fan since I got issue #1 when I was a kid so to see a fleshed out 2099 universe almost brought a tear to my eye. This is the mode the game was made for. Everything feels right. The fighting is a bit slower, which it needed to be, the graphics are hyper real and the camera works in your favour for a change. Miguel O\u2019Hara is not a smart alec so his lines are much more straight forward but his voice is a bit over-heroic. Overall, the 2099 levels feel so much better than the others by a long way. Makes you wonder why they didn\u2019t just make a Spider-Man 2099 game.\nSo here\u2019s yet another superhero game that just doesn\u2019t make the cut. Crap controls and confusing mode changes make the experience so frustrating. If you have wanted to see a 2099 universe realized well, rent this game because it\u2019s the only one we\u2019re going to see. Unfortunately, everything else, barring the voice acting, is terrible in different ways for different reasons. Even hardcore Spidey fans would be hard pressed to find anything to make them keep this title. Things were looking up, with Web of Shadows being a step in the right direction but this just feels cheap and nasty and with the huge amount of titles coming out over the next 2 months, this one can be gratefully forgotten.\n\u2013 Grant\n\nUser question:\nWhat are the four different universes in the Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions game?\n"}

A corporation that could change the outlook of our economy and the weight of our own wallets.\nI HAVE AN IDEA!\nA business IDEA. Not just my business but your business as well. My business is your business.\nThere is a process to get any business from start to finish, from concept to inception. This is called the start up process. That process refined could be a valuable commodity.\nAll businesses start with a concept, an IDEA. I have IDEAS. Any entrepreneur worth their salt has IDEAS. We all have thoughts, therefore we all have IDEAS. Not many of us go beyond the IDEA phase though. We hesitate out of fear of possible failure. The biggest problem is that we do not know the process for getting those IDEAS to market. This process held me up for far too long.\nI studied this process for more than one business IDEA, getting halted due to my limitations, essentially failing. I did not have enough skills and knowledge to start a business. There are many others in similar position.\nI continued my studies. I met with entrepreneur and business consultants and coaches to help me get to the next step. I learned the necessary steps, but I was still help back. I did not know enough, fearful and lacking in certain areas.\nI learned that there are others who have these same dreams, others who have necessary skills and assets that could help me achieve my dreams. If I could just find a way to get them to help, bring them together to make a complete circle, to complete the process. If I could help them make their IDEAS a reality. They could help me make my IDEAS a reality.\n- Business IDEAS\n- Inventions\n- Apps/Widgets\n- Software/Tech\n- Warehouse/Wholesale/Distribution\n- Writing/Publishing\nI also didn\u2019t have any means to pay these experts for their services. Every dollar amount I possess goes into paying off considerable debt, sad but true. I am aware of my circumstance but there is little I can do to change it. How then could I become a business owner if I was so limited and came up short at every step, especially. This is a difficult task indeed. I learned that financing was the least of my worries.\nHow many people give up because they just don\u2019t believe they can do it. 79% of people want to own a business. Yet there are few who complete the necessary steps. They back off, discouraged and disillusioned because they don\u2019t believe they are capable of owning a business.\nThis is where my IDEA comes into play. I HAVE AN IDEA! My IDEA is to help those who seriously desire to be their own boss but lack the faith in their capability to succeed. I know that there is a way that I can help those who have this dream.\nHow would I do it?\nBy compiling a team; starting a corporation. There are others who have skills and knowledge that amount to assets in the field of entrepreneurship. There are many who could and will help people become the business owner they dream of so fervently.\nWhy would they bother to help those would-be entrepreneurs? After all, we all want to know(WIIFM) What\u2019s in it for me?\nWhat\u2019s in it for me? Share a piece of the pie(% equity)!\nBecome invested in the businesses as they coach and assist with this process, share in the profit, then they would be more than willing to share their knowledge, wisdom and expertise. A give and take relationship between successful and aspiring entrepreneurs. We can work together for the greater good. Isn\u2019t that the dream of mankind too, to work together for the benefit of all?\nWe can help each other to achieve our dreams and stimulate the economy as well. By helping and encouraging new business owners the economy gets a much-needed infusion of wealth. Because we share in the start-up phase of the business, we become an investor in the business we get an infusion of wealth.\nToo many people complain, \u201cThe rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\u201d This concept can change that circumstance. It encourages and helps people in building up their own personal wealth.\nHow many businesses could we help start-up? How many businesses could we be invested in at one time because we helped get their business off the ground? How many people could we help to achieve their dreams? The possibilities are endless.\nI have business IDEAS and I was drawn up short. This does not stop me but I am sure it stopped far too many. We can create and utilize my IDEAS, your IDEAS and aspiring entrepreneurs IDEAS. In each instance there is a division of equity that is satisfactory to all parties.\nI am assembling a team. An opportunity exists. I am starting a corporation dedicated to building businesses, creating dreams, making IDEAS a reality.\nAs I have recently begun to share my vision and received some interest in the concept. I am looking for fellow like-minded entrepreneurs and founders. In fact the term serial entrepreneur applies best to this IDEA. I am seeking various business related skills and professionals to merge as teammates. Join forces to create a greater entity.\nI am meeting with people over the coming months.

Additionally, Midwest-Bayless Italian Auto does service, restoration and race prep at their facility; so if you want to update, upgrade, restore or turn you classic Fiat or Lancia into something even more special, this is the place to go.\nMatt knows his way around the Fiat X1/9, building show winning street cars and also competitive racing X1/9s. Driving his personally prepared SCCA Fiat X1/9, Matt is one of the nations best known Fiat racers and is having another successful season. Below are his latest racing exploits. You can get the latest updates on his Facebook page and website here:\nFor Immediate Release:\nMidwest-Bayless Italian Auto continues the 2012 SCCA National Club Racing season with very successful outings at Nelson Ledges Road Course and Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, completing four sanctioned SCCA National races in 10 days between May 25 and June 2, achieving three podium finishes with a Fiat X1/9 in H-Production class.\nMatt and his Fiat X1/9 were solidly in contention at each of the venues, recording two wins at Nelson Ledges, along with a 2nd and 4th place finish at Mid-Ohio.\n\u201cThe 2012 races at Nelson Ledges and especially the BFGoodrich SuperTour events at Mid-Ohio were great experiences. After winning both races at Nelson Ledges, we qualified on the outside pole both days at Mid-Ohio, in sloppy conditions with a field that included three past national champions. Our Fiat X1/9 led the Mid-Ohio races on both days, but unfortunately a broken exhaust header relegated us to a 4th place finish in Saturday\u2019s race, and tire management problems resulted in a 2nd place finish on Sunday. Even with these issues, the races were some of the most competitive regular season battles we\u2019ve ever had, and we turned our best lap times ever at Mid-Ohio, close to the track record. We really got the car dialed in after making some big changes to the driveline and suspension before the event. This gives us a lot of momentum for the rest of the season\u201d said Matt Brannon, owner/driver of the #22 Midwest-Bayless Fiat X1/9.\nMidwest-Bayless is now looking forward to remaining regular season SCCA races leading up to the 2012 SCCA National Championship Runoffs at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin.\nMidwest-Bayless Italian Auto (), based in Columbus, Ohio, is one of North America\u2019s largest sources of replacement parts, service, restoration and race prep services for \u201cclassic\u201d Fiat and Lancia vehicles.

{"prompt": "Context:\n.\nThe fact of the matter is that most national pro-choice organizations have very little staff in most states. There are exceptions, but in many cases, there might be only a single executive director and perhaps one or two other staff and interns to protect reproductive rights within the entire state. Of course, other organizations, such as state ACLU chapters, often devote resources to reproductive issues, but for North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota there is a single Planned Parenthood and a single communications director to cover all reproductive rights issues for all three states. For politicians in these states and others to feel beholden to their pro-choice constituents, more work needs to be done at organizing from the ground-up.\nThere is perhaps a better way of doing this than continuing to push money to the existing pro-choice organizations. After all, who better knows their state\u2019s issues, and the concerns of their community, than the clinics themselves?. It would be wonderful to see more support on this grassroots level, both of the financial and volunteer kind, to help protect and expand the work that clinics do.\nWith more funding and resources, clinics could strengthen\u2014or in some cases, create\u2014outreach programs to educate members of the community about their work and their services. The recent fight over defunding Planned Parenthood made it clear that many people still assume that abortion services are all that local PP clinics provide, when the reality is that so many other services are also available at these locations. Stronger outreach and education initiatives could go a long way in removing the stigma that is too often associated with pro-choice clinics.\nIn addition, local clinics know just what kind of messaging and outreach work best for their area. Just because an outreach campaign works in Kentucky doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be as successful in Michigan\u2014and understanding these nuances and the particular political, cultural, and economic landscape of individual communities is something that local clinics are very well equipped to work with. Increased funding can also be used to strengthen the communication arm of clinics, so that these messages are delivered in the most effective and targeted manner.\nIt might be unusual for a medical office to engage in so much activism and outreach work. Yet clinics all over the country are doing just that already. Two years ago, Sarah interviewed clinic directors in Florida and Alabama about their work, and found that for both women, lobbying at the state capital was an integral part of their jobs. In Alabama, the director had even worked with other pro-choice groups to fight against the distribution of medically inaccurate pamphlets at abortion clinics, and helped ensure that the women of the state received safe, unbiased information.\nFurther evidence of the benefits that this kind of community-level work can yield, can be seen in the work of Medical Students for Choice. The organization operates on a grassroots structure, trusting each local chapter to best know the needs of its school, students, and community. Individual chapters have been successful in both reforming their schools\u2019 curricula and conducting outreach and education work in their communities, and also receive support and guidance on both the regional and national level.\nBuilding out from the community level can yield results on the political front as well. A stronger local awareness about pro-choice issues could translate into stronger pro-choice voting and a demand for stronger pro-choice candidates. It\u2019s difficult to blame politicians for not defending local and state pro-choice issues when too often, pro-choice organizations have failed to do the groundwork for years.\nFor almost forty years, the country has been divided about abortion rights. While there have been significant pro-choice gains, there have also been a staggering number of losses on the state and federal level. Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding may be safe for now, but in too many parts of this country women either can\u2019t afford or can\u2019t access abortion care. Moving away from a top-down to a grassroots funding and lobbying strategy is not a perfect solution, but it seems that it is high time that we try something new.\nIt\u2019s a good idea, but I think there\u2019s a sustainability problem. A lot of Planned Parenthood chapters that used to be in a certain part of the state have merged up to statewide or larger chapters because it wasn\u2019t easy for the local clinics to fundraise for non-health care related activities on a sustainable basis. This is especially true in areas that were either only nominally pro-choice or totally anti-choice.\nI\u2019m not knocking the idea though- it\u2019s a good start!\nI agree with Stegan \u2013 but another challenge is that given most clinics\u2019 501c3 status, they may feel hesitant to get involved with political lobbying because it could jeopardize their status if they aren\u2019t also registered as a 501c4, which IS allowed to lobby. My guess is that the clinics who are doing lobbying work have both designations.\nAlthough I agree about the grassroots efforts, I think there needs to be some groundwork done by experienced activists to help train a new generation about how to effectively organize. The Walk for Choice in my city was only organized online \u2013 and as a result, there was a very small audience. Online activism is very important, but we can\u2019t abandon older methods of flyering, etc.\nJust my thoughts . . .\nI think you\u2019re right, Stegan, that affiliates have been merged to save money, and the result has been lower quality services for the merged areas, as well as less grassroots activism.\nIt\u2019s true that some areas can\u2019t financially sustain themselves, but to see real change, we still need to financially support activists in those areas while at the same time giving them autonomy to organize the areas that they know best.\nThis is in response to Serena \u2013 nonprofit, 501c3 organizations CAN lobby legally. A nonprofit cannot be engaged in electoral politics (endorsing candidates) but can absolutely lobby and engage in organizing and public policy. There are tons of resources available online on this issue, and I encourage everyone to check them out. Here is just one example: Let\u2019s end the myth that nonprofits can\u2019t lobby and educate ourselves about the powers we do have.\nI\u2019m a little confused by this post, but I think it\u2019s a good conversation. Firstly, I want to make it clear that all affiliates \u2013 PP and NARAL are specifcially who I am talking about here \u2013 rely (either very heavily or just a little) on funding from their respective national organizations. In addition to funding, they rely on the management, policy, communications, and (in the case of PP, as actual service providers) health care provision expertise of their national organizations.\nSecondly, I\u2019m confused by:\n\u201d\nDo you mean PP and NAF clinics, or nonaffiliated clinics? Is your argument that as an individual donor you should give to your local affiliate instead of your national? Again, a valdi point of view, but I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding correctly.\n(And yeah, the national lobby day was a hot mess. Coalition politics at its worst!)\n\nUser question:\nWhat are some of the challenges faced by local pro-choice clinics in terms of funding and outreach?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of James Gunn yet, I can assure you that you certainly will VERY soon. He directed a great movie a few years ago called Slither, and wrote the remake of Dawn of the Dead.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of James Gunn yet, I can assure you that you certainly will VERY soon. He directed a great movie a few years ago called Slither, and wrote the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Now he brings us Super, a dark, hilarious, and yet human, tale of one man against crime. Like, all of it.\nFrank D\u2019Arbo isn\u2019t really blessed with good looks, or a sparkling personality. He\u2019s a decent regular guy cooking at a local diner. When Sarah comes to work there, he\u2019s smitten. When Sarah, an ex-addict recently clean, takes an interest in Frank, he thinks he\u2019s the luckiest guy ever. But some time after they marry, sleazy Jacques gets Sarah back into drugs and he steals her away. Frank steels himself and is determined to get her back. He becomes the Crimson Bolt, a crime-fighting hero, despite the fact that he has no heroic powers or talent to speak of. But that\u2019s where the big monkey wrench comes in. No, seriously; a big, metal, fucking wrench.\nReaders, I need to prepare you for the best movie of 2011 so far, and maybe my favorite of the year by the time December rolls around. There, I said it. I really loved this movie. I hate to make any comparisons, but IF someone were to ask what this movie was like, I would say that Super is to 2011, as Kick Ass was to 2010. You have regular people deciding to become super heroes. But that\u2019s as far as the comparison goes, I can assure you.\nYou thought Kick Ass was dark? Super makes it look like a Gene Kelley or Danny Kaye musical. It\u2019s wonderfully funny in the way that you laugh while you\u2019re cringing. It\u2019s disturbing, and yet still full of humanity. It has a real story that has meaning and even when you\u2019ve stopped laughing, you realize that there is also some authentic emotion as well. A great part of why this works is the absolute dedication of the cast. Nobody fakes it or phones it in. Everyone owns their part and gives it everything they got. James Gunn knows a lot of great talent. This is a low budget movie that looks better than what I suspect the budget amounted to. Luckily most of these people were friends and wanted to make something great. Check out this cast: Rainn Wilson, Ellen Page, Liv Tyler, Kevin Bacon, Michael Rooker, Sean Gunn, Linda Cardellini, and Nathan Fillion \u2013 just for starters! And look for little surprises like Troma\u2019s Lloyd Kaufman, and the original Greatest American Hero, William Katt. If you don\u2019t know any of those names, well, your life must be a sad, vapid wasteland devoid of quality entertainment. Clearly you haven\u2019t taken enough advice from us here at Comedy Film Nerd central. Well, now is your chance for redemption!\nRainn Wilson as Frank is at times, downright mesmerizing. He commits wholly to his role and is at turns borderline psychotic, goofily funny, and then terribly tragic. And frankly, this is likely Ellen Page\u2019s most wonderful performance. Easily my favorite so far. From cute comic store sales girl to Bolty, the drunken with blood lust and, well, lustful, young super hero side kick. And again, total commitment to the role. She\u2019s amazing. And who doesn\u2019t love the idea of Kevin Bacon playing Jacques, the antagonist. Even he isn\u2019t walking through this. He\u2019s having too much fun. Everyone in Super appears to be.\nAgain, this is dark stuff, and violent. REALLY violent. It got some blood and gore \u2013 not for the squeamish. But it all looks great! For this budget film, they did a lot to make things look as real as possible.\nAnd the third act is so satisfying. It does exactly what you want it to do for a comic book movie. The big finale is joyously action-packed. But then, just when you think it will follow convention, it goes in a much needed, more realistic direction. There it goes, showing its\u2019 humanity again, leaving you feeling more satisfied than you though it would.\nSuper isn\u2019t a movie for everyone. I get that. It\u2019s probably not even a super-hero movie for everyone. But it is a GREAT movie for those who like their movies dark. NOT for kids \u2013 ever. This is for us grown-ups. But it\u2019s what this genre of film needs. This movie fucking rules. Better than I anticipated. Easy 4 1/2 kittenhands out of 5. Yeah, you heard me. Look for Super in theaters April 1st!\n~ Neil T.

{"prompt": "Context:\nIt\u2019s an interesting thought, how the world has become so connected in the past one hundred years, how the social networks and internet have both completely revolutionized the way we as humans interact, how we deal with each other, and how we communicate our thoughts and ideas. They have their perks and drawbacks to be sure, but for the time being both appear to be staying right where they are \u2013 if not growing substantially. They have invariably tied us all together, weaving quite a literal web about us \u2013 and yes, there may have been just a little pun intended. They have brought us together, all across the globe, as a whole, more than ever before.\nFor the first time ever we\u2019ve been able to have nearly instantaneous communication with anyone, anywhere. We\u2019ve never had the luxury of debating the price of eggs in China and actually being able to simultaneously find out just how much they really are, proving you right (or wrong) instantly. There are, without a doubt, a number of far more useful applications for the internet, such as research, medical advice, educational purposes, online dictionaries and reference material comprising hundreds of thousands of man hours, and humor all clearly being toward the top of the list \u2013 things for which it was clearly designed for.\nWith the communal web way that we\u2019ve seemed to have woven, we\u2019ve been tied together \u2013 for better or worse. Things that impact one country won\u2019t long be overlooked, what affects one nation will soon ripple across the web and alert us all, like a fly hitting a spider\u2019s web, sending out those thrumming vibrations that will soon attract the masses. And it doesn\u2019t take long for something to become a literal overnight success, attaining instant stardom in the blink of an eye. What took years or decades before can happen in the blink of an eye.\nIts true, that to an extent, our economies, as with ourselves, have been tied together. We\u2019ve truly become a global market. When one country hurts, its likely others will feel the effects soon enough. And when the market crashes in Freedonia, you can bet top dollar that the people of Sylvania will soon hear about it and react accordingly \u2013 in no small part due to the internet. It doesn\u2019t really matter if they are next door neighbors or thousands of miles apart when the internet is involved.\nAs our economies and lives have been linked inexplicably together, so to have our hobbies with them, our interests and our crafts. And this can be a truly great thing where art is concerned, tapping into the vast creative potential offered up and the talents and know how of some very skilled, very creative people. Some of it can get lost in the shuffle to be true, but every little bit does help in the end. Tutorials, examples, concepts, ideas, techniques, tools. There are a lot of good uses out there. And just like any tool, the internet can be used in hundreds of ways.\nBut right now the world has entered a time when funding is in short order, a time of economic recession. During these times, things can get tight and very difficult. People are starting to be more frugal, looking how they budget, how they spend their money and to what ends it goes to. And this doesn\u2019t just affect one nation \u2013 its spread out to us all. While we\u2019ve been bound together for better or worse, we\u2019ve also been tied together for richer or poorer. Thankfully it\u2019s usually around this time when people start looking into other methods of doing things, more hands on and artistic approaches.\nIt\u2019s a good feeling when you can step back and see something that you\u2019ve made, whether your creation is for many people or simply something that you made for your own enjoyment. It\u2019s during times like this when people need art to brighten up their lives, to bring a smile and spark creativity. If we can go that extra mile to put that one extra little embellishment in our project, it usually brings a smile to our faces and another idea with it. By putting just a little more effort into our project, we can have that effect, that inspiration for the next project before this one is even finished. On top of making things a bit more interesting for our daily humdrum, art is also a great release. It offers us a creative outlet, an activity to get our mind off the daily things that drive us mad. A blank piece of paper can be a great therapy, one with limitless potential. And sometimes all we really want to do is get our hands dirty and do something worthwhile.\nRight now, all across the world, people are looking back into different techniques, more hands on approaches. The saying is true, fortune favors the brave \u2013 and especially right now. We just have to try, but more importantly, keep trying. It\u2019s fine and dandy to try, and fail once, then walk away, but to keep trying is really the challenge.\nWhat you do doesn\u2019t have to be much, it doesn\u2019t have to be big either. You just need to keep doing what you love to do and make it work for you.\n\nUser question:\nHow has the internet impacted global communication and economies?\n"}

And that was actually the most challenging thing about making the dress...getting that front line cut from the silk crepe and then stitched down to the front of the dress.\nOtherwise this is a very easy and basic dress to make. What makes it so awesome IMHO is the fabric choice...it will be perfect for the 90 degree day that is forecasted for tomorrow.\nOne more shot of it with the floral cardigan:\nNot sure if I'm actually going to wear this combination...but we'll see.

My e-mail address is opal215@gmail.com\nOh yeah, loving the red dress. Smart move with the vertical stripe. I think a horizontal one would have worked too, between the shoulder and underarm, and would have looked very 60's retro.\nLove the red dress with the \"vertical stripe\" down the middle! It's superb!\nGreat dress, Carolyn. You rock this color.\nWear more red, it's a fantastic colour on you!\nI love the red/white dress - and I think the vertical line is much more flattering (to most of us) than the horizontal would have been.\nAs far as the Architecture dress, I think you just need to step away from it for a few days and let the frustration of it fade and you'll be able to see it with fresh eyes. Personally, I love it, but if you decide you don't, I have every confidence that you'll figure out SOMETHING to make it right.\nOh, that is fantastic! What a fun little dress. :) I like it with the floral cardigan for summer, but I think it could also work with a dark grey or black cardigan for fall.\nNo wardrobe is complete without a great red dress, and this dress definitely fills that bill.

You can create a whole set up of Lego scene such as you can use Lego animals and bricks to create a zoo for your fish to explore, make a Lego home for your fish by building a house, make some Lego construction vehicles and set up Lego men for working on construction inside the tank or select a movie or superhero and use Lego with that theme to recreate a fictional undersea world. The plastic used in Lego bricks is safe for fish which makes them a good option for putting in an aquarium. But remember not to use any glue with the blocks as it can contaminate the fish water, and Lego creations should be cleaned thoroughly before using them and whenever you clean the tank.\nBeautiful Greenery\nAdding plants to the aquarium is relatively inexpensive and effortless to find. You can buy them at a local pet shop. Usually, a bunch sells for under 2$. Moreover, you can obtain free cuttings from some other fish keepers at a local aquarium club meeting as well. Plants like Java fern or Java moss are comparatively easy to grow than some other plants and can create an underwater jungle if proper care is given to them.\nFloating Bottle with a Message\nA message in a bottle is always mysterious and interesting. You can simply add a floating bottle to your aquarium with small little things you have around your home. This idea can work in almost any size of aquarium. Place a few marbles or some weight at the bottom to make it heavier on the top in order to keep your bottle floating upright. For this idea you can select an antique bottle to give some real old-world feel or choose a colored bottle for a pop of red, green or blue, or an amusing gift, you can write a special message on a piece of paper and put it in the bottle allowing the note to show through the glass. Using a glass bottle is totally safe for fish but you should avoid using plastic bottles and natural corks as corks can become water-logged and become a breeding place of germs.\nChina Tea Sets\nIf you have a few beautiful china tea sets at home that you no longer use, they can be adorable and one of the most unexpected options for aquarium d\u00e9cor ideas. You can put a lace table cloth under the aquarium to create a fancy and elegant feeling from the outside or you can place the whole of teapot inside the aquarium, ensuring there is sufficient space for your fish to swim in and out of it. Moreover, you can also use your children\u2019s miniature tea set depicting a small tea party in an aquarium. You should note that only food-safe ceramics can be used in a fish tank. You should have many options since the china cabinet is full of food-safe dishes. But you should avoid using delicate finishes that can flake off like silver or gold leaf on the edges of saucers and cups.\nAdd Rocks\nAdding rocks to an aquarium is an inexpensive idea that creates a visual delight inside it. But those rocks should be avoided that can unpleasantly change the pH. You should always test this by placing the rock first in a bucket of water taken from the tank. Test the pH of water in the bucket and then retest it each day for many days in order to determine if there is any variation.\nRiver stones are a good choice for freshwater aquariums due to their smooth round shape suggests that moving water and anything that may discharge out of the rock has already been washed away. In addition to this, you should avoid rocks that are made of clay or mud because they can dissolve and turn the water murky. You should also ensure to sterilize the rocks by soaking them in bleach water for a few days. After that soak them in clean water along with aquarium dechlorinator before placing them inside the aquarium.\nHoliday theme\nThe holidays are an amazing time for being creative with the decoration of your aquariums, particularly if you have some additional holiday d\u00e9cor available. You can use this aquarium d\u00e9cor idea for any holiday from Easter to Halloween to Christmas. For trying this idea you can pick up some plain and colored glass ornaments and remove its hanging hardware. After that fill the ornaments with water and place them inside the aquarium on its bottom. Furthermore, if you have food-safe figurines for holidays such as Easter bunny-shaped salt and pepper shakers, you can put them in the aquarium. You can also add holiday lights all around on the exterior of the aquarium to bring even more beauty and cheer. But you should remember to avoid anything that is sharp or painted to ensure your fish\u2019s health and safety. Similarly, consumable items should also be kept away. But you can use such things on the outside of the aquarium. This holiday d\u00e9cor idea can create a cute little aquarium holiday decoration.\n\nUser question:\nWhat are some of the unique and affordable decoration ideas for an aquarium?\n"}

She is just crying out for Help, even though you're all in a legal fight lend a hand, get her family in there to help her before it's too late.\nGood luck - I'm sure doing this in the media is a million times harder then if it was a private matter.\nPoor her, I was really hoping that she wouldn't hit a wall or rock bottom this hard. I'd like to think it wouldn't have gotten this far and this bad if the press had just backed the hell off a long time ago. I can't stand the tackiness of some of these articles.

It is pathetic the way Britney can not have any type of privacy what so ever, she is a human being even if she is famous she should be able to go about her life without having cameras following her and asking her idiotic questions all the time. Just because SHE is famous does not mean that she wants to be in the spot light 24/7so what if she went out partying after getting a divorce, Who has not done that? Maybe she could get her life back together and be able to focus on her children if people would just leave her alone and let her have some peace. after this latest incident is it not obvious that she needs time to get back on track? Stress can do so much damage mentally and physically to a person, but only they can make the changes neccesary to cope with lifes stressors.

{"prompt": "Context:\nWe get off the train in Simperofol, and take a bus towards Kazantip. The moment we're out of the terminal, the driver stops and picks up a new passenger in what is certainly a pre-arranged plan to bypass the full fare, a way for the driver to augment his meager income. Along the way, he picks up several more paying hitchhikers- common in the Ukraine.\nThere's almost no civilization over the two hour ride, just vast expanses of flat, largely barren ground. It's hot outside, so I purchase three ice creams at a stop, and try to gift them to my new friends Viktoriia and Dmytro, but they refuse the sugar. I'm not eating three of these ...\nI hand one off to the cliche fat guy sitting next to them, and start scanning for another worthy candidate. I spot a small boy 50 feet away whom I walk to. He shakes his head at the offer.\nWhat? Seriously?\nThe ice cream cost a dollar, and given that Ukrainians earn $500 a month, this likely isn't an everyday treat. I return and relate my surprise to Dmytro who opens his eyes wide, and warns that someone is going to call the cops on me. I guess it's been awhile since I wasn't allowed to take candy from a stranger. I sit down for a moment and ponder what to do with my rapidly melting gift.\nMy answer approaches, it's the little boy nodding his head excitedly, extending his hand; he smiles enthusiastically as he walks away with his treat.\nMinutes later, like any narcissist, I check in on my work and observe the boy sharing the ice cream with his sister. I smile at his parents who nod back. There will be no police line-up today.\nKazantip- not exactly on the map\nAt last we arrive in Kazantip, located on the Black Sea in the Crimean Peninsula of the Ukraine, in the center of the middle of nowhere. Surrounding Kazantip (which technically is just a large gated party area on the beach) are two tiny towns and then a vast void of nothingness for a fifty mile plus radius.\nThe woman who owns the small apartment building we're staying in, its tiny rooms essentially just a bed and bathroom, explains that all money is made during the summer months, the rest of the year the area is a complete ghost town. She makes enough during the summer, she tells me, to be able to to hibernate through the winter.\nThe rooms rent for $25-$35 a night (depending on if you have AC) and go up in price when the party in Kazantip really kicks into gear. They'll also be happy to cook for you, and meals are very reasonably priced, the food fresh, grown locally, and all organic; farmers here can't afford pesticides. Thank God right.\n(I'm also introduced to a Ukrainian beverage called \"kvass.\" Learn a little about in this video.)\nThe people here are much friendlier than Kiev. The waitress who served me was absolutely elated when I taught her how to say, \"Enjoy your meal,\" in English. Every time she served me over my week long stay she would proudly use the phrase and walk away with a huge smile on her face.\n(just see how desolate my surroundings are, as I explore the area)\nCommunistic Storefront\nThe grocery store of the neighboring town is managed like a relic of Communist Times, a model of complete inefficiency. You wait in line, and when you finally make to the front, you tell the clerks what it is you desire, they go and get it for you, then come back to the counter and ring it up. Five people in line ahead of me buying less than five items each, and I waited 15 minutes just to purchase a bottle of water. Only one line of course. In fairness, they don't call it \"the express.\"\nThe only logical reason for this set-up that I could think is how common theft appears to be in the Ukraine, and this is an attempt by the shop to combat it.\nI'll tell you this, leave something out in the Ukraine, kiss it good-bye. Left a bottle of water atop my suitcase lugging it around Simerafopol, come back two minutes later, I'm going thirsty. Leave my flip-flops beside some other shoes while I run on the beach, come back, and have to walk barefoot back to my lodgings.\nMy strategy for purchasing anything in the Ukraine was to put whatever I was buying on the counter, or point to what I needed, let them tell me in Ukrainian how much I owed, nod my head as if I understood, pull some money out of my pocket and pray they gave correct change. At no point should you open your mouth. The moment they realize you're American, here comes the surcharge.\nClean and Beautiful\nThe weather is warm, and the sea refreshing, the water an almost tropical blue and surprisingly clean and translucent. Being out in the middle of nowhere, there is zero pollution and the sky is crystal clear. This isn't a beach of Southern Thailand, but it's far nicer than I expected.\nMozzie Magnet\nI go at sundown to meditate on the beach, which is normally a great plan in Los Angeles, but not the best idea here. Within two minutes I've been viciously attacked, and am left with what I consider to be massive injuries- twelve mosquito bites. I beat Usain Bolt back to the motel.\nMy whole body is in utter despair, I don't have enough hands to scratch where I need. It gnaws at my mind which I feel like tearing out of my skull so I won't feel the burning itching sensation over every square inch of my body. There is absolutely no relief from this. I'm in the center of the middle of nowhere, surrounded by an army of mosquitoes, and no way out. I wonder what drew me all the way out here begin with. I must be insane.\nDmytro sees me scratching. \"Don't you know how active mosquitoes here are at dusk? Everyone hides til it gets dark. Only an idiot goes to the beach at this hour. Didn't you wonder why you were the only one out there?\" He leaves shaking his head.\nI think about what he's said and look at the bright side. At least 'idiot' is a big step above insanity. I feel a little relieved. An encouraging word can do wonders now and then.

{"prompt": "Context:\nPerformance-wise, it's difficult to peg down who had the best stage presence, because I was impressed by different elements from each go-round. Pop Evil was more well-known, so naturally the crowd carried a higher excitement level, but I also just felt a solid energized rock vibe from them as a whole. They would probably take the cake for best appearance as well, since the lead singer Leigh Kakaty (a dude) was probably the hottest person on stage that night, and the luscious locks of long hair on the bassist Matt Dirito were tantalizing to watch as he expertly headbanged his way to a promising migraine. Seriously, this guy came on stage and I immediately thought, \"He has Pocahontas' hair, and it's way prettier than mine! Not fair.\" If you've never payed attention to anyone whipping such long hair like that around in the air, it's quite a sight, let me tell you. I used to just think it was cool and all if the rockstars want to get a little crazy while playing their instruments, but it's actually FUN to watch. Is it weird of me to think that? I hope I'm not the only one that does.\nMatt Dirito.\nCan't take credit for this pic - my camera sucked\nCan't take credit for this pic - my camera sucked\nat the concert. This is a la internet.\nEven before Pop Evil dazzled the audience with their catchy songs and pumped up attitude, Aranda surprised me with a few tricks up their own sleeve. At first I didn't realize the guys setting up the equipment in plaid flannel and skinny jeans were the actual band, but when they started playing they definitely didn't sound like any emo posers. The guitarist Damien Aranda was especially skilled, as displayed most prominently during their cover of Led Zep's \"Dazed and Confused.\" After that face melter, they did some cool things with the guitar where the lead singer would hold it parallel to the ground while Damien sort of played the strings like a keyboard, even going so far as to pull what I'm assuming is his signature move and use his designer boot to play the instrument at the same time. He used a delicate sweeping motion over the strings, which made a really cool effect when paired with the high speed plucking thing. It was very unique, something I have never seen or heard of before.\nBlack Cloud Collective's performance was unfortunately mediocre. I have a feeling their tracks are probably better on a CD than you would observe from hearing them live, because the volume of their many sounds together was so loud over the singer's voice, you could barely hear the melodies in their songs. When I did catch a glimpse of some kind of musical pattern, I thought, \"That's actually not bad, but I wish I could understand some of the words,\" because yeah, the sound levels were a little imbalanced, but also the lead singer was not an articulate one at all. My friend commented about him not quite looking the part, which I felt too, but on the other hand I liked that the majority of the other guys sported rugged beards as their go-to hair style, because it was different from most of the bands I've seen.\nBy the time Rev Theory finally came on, people were anxious to hear the band they'd been waiting for, but sadly more than one technical problem led to a performance that didn't live up to expectations. The microphone was doing a horrible job at picking up sound, so the lead singer Rich Luzzi (who looked like a cross between Stanley Tucci and my more attractive cousin, Greg) basically had to scream his lungs out for us to hear anything, and frankly that just sounded bad. On a side note, I just googled Luzzi and found some awesome pictures of him with a different look, one that included many ripped muscles and a lack of upper body clothing. I may rescind my statement that Leigh Kakaty was the hottest person on stage. But anyway, the vocal problems were a let down, and I honestly expected to hear more songs that I knew. The only redeeming factor was that the last two songs of the night - \"Hell Yeah\" and \"Justice\" - were the most kickass in their repertoire, and completely filled up my satisfaction bar.\nAll in all I was pleased with the bang for my buck ($13), since I had mostly been exposed to bands that I'll probably get some music from in the near future. I quite enjoyed my time at this venue that I'd never been to before. Typically at concerts I can get cranky real easily if I'm standing the entire night, especially between bands when there is nothing going on. Luckily this place had rows of rectangular block benches that we could rest on while waiting for the next band, and that might've been one of the contributing factors to the night being a success. Feet and back aches were minimal, and I was able to maintain a *lovely* personal space bubble because the place wasn't jam-packed, and we happened to pick one of the best spots in the room to sit. The only thing that needed fixing was their bathroom - two stalls is not enough for a hundred women. But that won't deter me from attending concerts at this venue again (ask me the name if you're interested) because like I said, it was a successful night. Thus ends my post on the 9th concert of my life so far!\nAnd listen to that song up there. It's one of my faves, possibly ever. In the category of hyped up rock, anyway.\nAnd listen to that song up there. It's one of my faves, possibly ever.

{"prompt": "Context:\n\nBlood\nOrange Sorbet, Sweat & Tears\nNovember 8\nTonight's judges...\n- Trendsetting restauranteur Chris Santos\n- Star executive chef Alex Guarnaschelli\n- Italian maestro Scott Conant\nRound 1: APPETIZER (20 minutes).\nThe first box of the night has... breakfast sausage, cantaloupe, potato rolls,\nand coconut flakes.\nAnd time... starts .... *checks watch*...\nNOW!\nSonia: Melon & Chive Salad\nCharles: Sausage & Coconut Slider\nArthur: Panzanella Salad\nShawn: Fried Sausage & Melon Spring Roll\nThe judges have yet to put anything\ntogether using the four ingredients, whereas Arthur has already put\ntogether a gremolata. Shawn's spring roll idea is 86'ed for...\nShawn: Warm Meat Salad with Fried Bread.\nSonia crusted the bread with coconut. The\nsalad is brought out by the vinegar. The coconut is a little burned,\nwhile the bread is soggy. Charles uses the melon very whimsically. The\nside salad doesn't measure up to the creativity of the burger. Arthur's\ndish achieved a textural contrast, but the salad could've used some\ngreen. Shawn's salad is like him as a 101st Airborne... quick on his\nfeet and not that overpowering. The cantaloupe made the sausage juicy,\nbut the bread could've done without.\nThe dishes were cleaned and composed,\ncreative and impressive. On the other hand, one will not measure up to\npar. The first chef... to be chopped... is... SHAWN. He was able\nto adjust with four minutes, but the bread was overcooked and the\npresentation left a lot to be desired.\nRound 2: ENTREE (30 minutes).\nOne down, two to go. Next on the menu... fiddlehead\nferns, sablefish, vadouvan, and blood orange sorbet.\nHalf an hour to make something happen.\nSonia: Vadouvan-Dusted Sablefish\nCharles: Vadouvan-Crusted Fish with Blood Orange Sauce\nArthur: Fiddlehead Fern Carbonara\nVadouvan is a French Indian spice mix.\nBoth Charles and Sonia are working from\nthe same pile of polenta.\nCharles' fish is cooked flawlessly. The\npolenta is very good. Together, they're brilliant. The technique and\ntaste if borderline obscene. The sauce, though, is uncomfortably\nreduced. Arthur is wildly creative with use of ingredients. The potatoes\nhe used were delicious, but at the same time, it doesn't belong on the\nplate. and he used way too much butter. The polenta on Sonia's dish\nneeded to be liquefied a little more, and her ancho chilies have not\ncooked. But she leaves the sorbet in its purest form.\nThis is going to be decided on\ncreativity, as in, who created, and who was a creative failure? The next\nperson... to be chopped... is... ARTHUR. The main fell short with the\noveruse of the cheese and butter taking away from the ingredients.\nRound 3: DESSERT (30 minutes).\nAnd this is where success pays. Sonia and Charles are now one basket away from\n$10,000. In said basket... sour beer, cherimoya, raspberries, and brown bread in\na can.\nGood luck, chefs... and GO!\nSonia: Bread Pudding\nCharles: Brown Bread Pain Perdu with Maple Cherimoya Coulis\nBefore we continue, Ted issues a warning.\nDo not eat or serve the seeds in the cherimoya, a fruit native to the\nmiddle east. They're bad for you. In fact, they may even kill you.\nCharles decided early on to cook the\nfruit whole. That doesn't go over well with the judges, so he's left to\nspend a great amount of time removing the seeds. Meanwhile, he ends up\nburning his caramel. Sonia is making a campers' style bread pudding with\na beer zabaglione.\nSonia's bread pudding with zabaglione is\nmissing some of the beer flavor, but she has a deep understanding of the\ningredients. Charles' caramel has a richness and a roundness, but he\nstruggled with the raspberry mousse.\nOne chef rose over the course of the\nmeal, while one chef fell from the start. Sonia's dessert was the\nstrongest, while Charles' entree was probably the best ever cooked in\nthe nine seasons of the show. Sonia's appetizer was cleaner, while\nCharles' was more creative.\nThe final chef... to be chopped... is...\nSONIA! She was at a high level today, but in the end... CHARLES LOPEZ\nwas a little bit better. And that little bit adds up to $10,000. Spend\nit, save it, frame it..\n\nUser question:\nWho won the cooking competition and what was the prize?\n"}
{"prompt": "Context:\nAirto Moreira, Atlantic Starr, Chick Corea, Chipmunks, Discogs, George Harrison, Miles Davis, New Order, Nirvana, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Randy Newman, Rolling Stone Top 500 Albums, Stan Getz, Stanley Clarke, The BCPF, The Less Desirables, The Less Desirables Network, The Pixies, The Who, Tony WIlliams, Underdog Records, Wings, Yes\nSalutations\u2122!!\nFinally, after a break of several weeks, I have a haul to write about. Yay, me! It was good to get back in Underdog Records, see Jonathan, bin dive and then actually getting some good record listening time in. Here\u2019s what we got:\n\u00a9Columbia\n- New Order \u2013 Movement \u2014 The debut album from New Order after the death of Ian Curtis and thus ending Joy Division. The BCPF says \u201cthis is my jam.\u201d Needless to say, she likes it. I didn\u2019t mind it. It was decent. New.\n- Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind \u2014 In September when the anniversary of this album came around, I went to play it in honor of the milestone. I looked and looked and looked. I couldn\u2019t find it. I looked on Discogs and it wasn\u2019t there, either. I keep a list of the RS list to see what I have collected from it. It wasn\u2019t marked there, either. I was flabbergasted. How did I not have it? Well, I didn\u2019t and now, I can\u2019t say that anymore. I got it yesterday. I hated it when it came out. I hated the idea of grunge taking over the hair band scene. I\u2019ve talked about that ad nauseum, so I\u2019ll leave it be. This was new.\n- Pixies \u2013 Surfer Rosa \u2014 I actually got this last week when I couldn\u2019t stay away from Underdog. It\u2019s one of The BCPF\u2019s faves and we know I want her to get what she wants, even when she didn\u2019t know it was there to want. The record that is, she knew about the album. VG++.\n- Stan Getz \u2013 Captain Marvel \u2014 This album is great! Not only do you get the lyrical sexy saxy stylings of Stan Getz but you get Chick Corea on electric piano, Stanley Clarke on bass, Airto Moreira on percussion and drum hall of fame member (and drummer for Miles Davis) Tony Williams. Such great stuff. VG+.\n- Wings \u2013 Wings Over America \u2014 a 3xLP live album from Sir Paul (before he was Sir) and company. It is heavy, for sure. It feels like it weighs about 10 pounds, but really it is only about one. Haven\u2019t listened yet. VG+.\n- George Harrison \u2013 Dark Horse \u2014 Not my favorite George album, but it has some great spots. The BCPF was excited to get it. VG+.\n- Randy Newman \u2013 Trouble In Paradise \u2014 I love Randy Newman and when I see something from him that I don\u2019t already have, I need to get it. This has the hit \u201cI Love LA\u201d and a tune called \u201cThe Blues\u201d which is a duet with Paul Simon. VG+.\n- Yes \u2013 Going For The One \u2014 The eighth studio album from Yes, which marked the return of Rick Wakeman who had left to do other things two albums prior. It\u2019s only 5 songs but it is full-length. A lot of proggy goodness here. VG+.\n- The Who \u2013 Face Dances \u2014 The 1981 follow-up to the Quadrophenia album in 1979. It has the song \u201cYou Better You Bet\u201d and is pretty fine. VG.\n- Atlantic Starr \u2013 All In The Name Of Love \u2014 I will admit that I purchased this (for $2) just because of one song. That song is \u201cAlways.\u201d I have always loved it. It serves my R&B Slow Jam sensibilities. VG.\n- The Chipmunks \u2013 Urban Chipmunk \u2014 Yeah, you read that correctly. I\u2019ve had more comments (positive ones) about this album than most any other recently. I even had someone offer to buy it from me already. Why? Because it\u2019s a memory from our childhood. I wanted this when I was a kid and never got it. I had a cousin who had it. My sister had Chipmunk Punk which was a better album, but I wanted both of them. I haven\u2019t found the Punk one and loved finding this one. And, yes, it is as awful as you\u2019d think it would be, but that\u2019s a glorious thing! Even though it was a $1 bin find, it was in VG+ condition.\nUnderdog Records is THE Official Music Sponsor of The Less Desirables. They have fantastic vinyl choices and players. There are also a few cassettes because apparently, that\u2019s a thing again? Listen to the weekly episode of TLD to hear what the TLD/Underdog Special of the week is. Watch the social media channels for Underdog Records to see what is going freshly onto the sales floor.\nI use Discogs to keep track of my collection. I spent a lot of time bin diving with my app on the phone open so I could check that I did or didn\u2019t have the great stuff I was finding.\nUntil tomorrow, same blog channel\u2026\nScorp out!\n\u2014\n\u201cI call you on the telephone my voice too rough with cigarettes. I sometimes feel?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou Better You Bet\u201d (Townshend)\n\nUser question:\nWhat is the debut album from New Order after the death of Ian Curtis?\n"}
